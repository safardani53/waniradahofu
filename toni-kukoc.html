He was born to parents Ante Kuko</span>č <span>and Radojka Kukoč.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/toni-kukocs-family.jpg><p><span>His father, Ante, worked in a shipyard in which almost half of the city worked. He was also an athlete, playing water polo and handball.</span></p><p><span>His mother, Rajojka, worked as a secretary.</span></p><p>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Muggsy Bogues Bio: Height, Basketball Career, NBA, Net worth, &Wiki</a></strong></p><h3><span>The Versatile One</span></h3><p><span>Tony Kukoc amazes people with his versatility. He played soccer when he was young.</span></p><p><span>He had praiseworthy hand-eye coordination, which impressed his teammates as well. Toni was a champion at ping pong/table tennis. He also received different youth category titles in table tennis.</span></p><p><span>He was attracted to golf after retirement from the NBA and became a scratch golfer. Toni underwent a hip replacement surgery in 2009 and was disturbed from playing.</span></p><p><span>He now plays at least one round of golf daily. He also won Croatia’s national amateur golf championship in 2011.</span></p><p><span>The multi-skilled Kukoc is also an all-rounder basketball player. His natural position was small forward, but he played all five positions on the court.</span></p><p><span>He not just played it but showed strong court vision and an outside shooting touch that was usually not found in players of his height. Toni stands at 6 feet 10 inches (208 cm).</span></p><h3><span>Basketball: How it started?</span></h3><p><span>Toni had not played basketball for the first 13-14 years of his life. He visited the beach one day with his friends when he was about 14, and then a basketball coach noticed him.</span></p><p><span>The coach saw his long legs and asked Toni if he was interested. Toni was flexible and could quickly adapt to the sport of any kind. Hence, he agreed to coordinate. There has been no going back since then.</span></p><p><span>Basketball became his home, first playing in the NBA and working as an advisor to a top-rated NBA team.</span></p><p><span>Toni then joined the city team. They were made to practice a lot and were not allowed to play until they practiced.</span></p><p><span>Toni liked the environment around basketball. He then stopped going to school at the age of 15 and instead attended practices held in the morning, evening, and afternoon.</span></p><p><span>It was something like, ‘yes I go to school but occasionally.’ The teachers at school were also interested in games, and they would ask Toni about who they would play with next in his ‘once in a while school visit.’</span></p><p>You might also be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Andre Iguodala Bio: Basketball, NBA, Business, & Net Worth</a></strong></p><h3><span>This or That</span></h3><p><span>The school then sent a notice to Toni’s mother about him getting expelled as he had missed 200 days.</span></p><p><span>His mother was shocked and mad at him. She then went to the club and said that Toni was one injury away from never playing again. The club had to make a deal with the school.</span></p><p><span>Toni was fortunate as the GM of his team, and his school’s deans were cousins. An agreement was made stating that Toni would practice but at the same time read and attend exams at the end of the year.</span></p><p><span>Toni could only score 48 in Chemistry in finals when 50 was the passing mark. The teacher said that Toni had to repeat the class in the summer.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Toni-Kukoc-basketball-1024x576.jpg><p><span>But Toni said that he was leaving with the national team and would never come back.</span></p><p><span>He says that he always thought about the NBA while playing in Croatia.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tacko Fall Bio: Basketball Career, NBA, Height, & Family>></a></strong></p><h2><span>Toni Kuko</span>č <span>– Professional Basketball Career</span></h2><h3><span>Europe</span></h3><p><span>He started playing basketball from his home town club, KK Jugoplastika, at the age of 17. He was one of the best players to have played with the club, achieving significant success.</span></p><p><span>The team became the winner at the prestigious EuroLeague for three seasons consecutively (1989–1991), with Toni on their side.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, they earned the Triple Crown in 1990 and 1991. Also, Toni was named the EuroLeague Final Four Most Valued Player (MVP) both times.</span></p><p><span>He then transitioned from KK Jugoplastika to Benetton Treviso. He stood up as the winner of the Italian League championship in 1992. Similarly, he won the Italian Cup in 1993.</span></p><p><span>Toni was also a participant in the EuroLeague final in 1993. Moreover, he won the EuroLeague Final Four MVP again.</span></p><p><span>People gave Toni various nicknames: the White Magic, the Spider from Split, the Pink Panther, the Waiter, and the Croatian Sensation.</span></p><p><span>He received the European Basketball Player of the Year Awards several times throughout the decade of the 1990s.</span></p><h3><span>Chicago Bulls</span></h3><p><span>The Chicago Bulls drafted Toni in Round 2 of the 1990 NBA draft, 29th overall.</span></p><p><span>However, he gave continuity to his games in Europe for almost three years. He then finally reported to the Chicago Bulls in 1993.</span></p><p><span>The team had just finished its first three-peat and had lost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> to retirement by that time. Toni was utterly disappointed that he could not play with Jordan.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">77 motivating Michael Jordan Quotes</a></strong></p><p><span>He then played his NBA debut game on November 5, 1993.</span></p><p><span>He started in the 1993–1994 seasons behind small forward <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen</a> and power forward Horace Grant. However, he could play shooting guard and center as well.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen Bio: Childhood, Career, and Net Worth</a></strong></p><p><span>He had a promising rookie season as he averaged double-digit, and scored and earned a berth on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.</span></p><p><span>Toni then moved into the starting lineup, finishing the 1994–1995 seasons. He stood second in the Chicago Bulls in terms of scoring, rebounds, and assists. He was behind <a href=#>Scottie Pippen</a>.</span></p><p><span>Michael Jordan returned to the Chicago Bulls for the 1995–1996 seasons. Toni was more than pleased to hear the news. This will to play alongside Jordan was going to be fulfilled.</span></p><p><span>The entire members of Chicago Bulls were motivated and excited by Jordan’s return to full form and also the offseason acquisition of exceptional rebounder <a href=#>Dennis Rodman</a>.</span></p><h3>And Then</h3><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen</a> was still at small forward. Similarly, coach Phil Jackson decided to let&nbsp; Tony continue to be a bench player.</span></p><p><span>Tony stood up third on the team in scoring in the 1995-1996 seasons. He was behind <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen</a>.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen Bio: Childhood, Career, and Net Worth>></a></strong></p><p><span>He earned the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award as his efforts were acknowledged.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;Toni then contributed to leading the Chicago Bulls to a 25-game turnaround. They set the best record in league history at the time at 72–10. It was later surpassed by the 2015–16 Golden State Warriors.</span></p><p><span>The Chicago Bulls also won the fourth championship in team history.</span></p><p><span>Toni was the fourth and is currently the last player to have received the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award and the same year’s NBA title. McHale, Bill Walton, and<a href=#> Bobby Jones</a> had achieved that feat earlier.</span></p><p><span>Toni again came off the bench as the sixth man as the Chicago Bulls won their fifth and sixth NBA titles in 1997 and 1998. He became the team’s third-leading scorer.</span></p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">77 motivating Michael Jordan Quotes</a></strong></p><h2><span>Toni Kuko</span>č <span>– </span><span>Career ending and retirement</span></h2><p><span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scottie Pippen</a> was traded to the Houston Rockets in early 1999. The deal literally broke up the Chicago Bulls dynasty.</span></p><p><span>Kukoč was one of the only players from their championship team left at the Chicago Bulls.</span></p><p><span>He led the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists in the lockout-shortened 1998–1999 seasons.</span></p><p><span>Kukoč was then traded to the Philadelphia 76ers during the 1999–2000 seasons as Chicago Bulls continued their rebuilding scheme.</span></p><p><span>It was a three-team deal involving the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors sent Bruce Bowen, <a href=#>John Starks</a>, and a 2000 first-round pick to the Chicago Bulls.</span></p><p><span>Kukoc was dealt with the Atlanta Hawks the following season. Nazr Mohammed, Pepe Sánchez, and Theo Ratliff were also dealt with along with him.</span></p><p><span>It was in a blockbuster deal where they sent Dikembe Mutombo and Roshown McLeod to the 76ers.</span></p><p><span>Kukoč was again traded to the Milwaukee Bucks after a brief period with the Atlanta Hawks. He was along with Leon Smith, in a deal to acquire <a href=#>Glenn Robinson</a>.</span></p><p><span>Kukoč might have been annoyed with the constant trading and transition. He announced that he would retire from professional basketball if either the Milwaukee Bucks or the Chicago Bulls did not sign him for the 2006–07 NBA.</span></p><p><span>The announcement was made on September 12, 2006.</span></p><p><span>Many NBA teams showed interest in signing Tony Kukoc, but he chose to move always.
