On Jan. 19, Andrade was arrested after he broke into Yoatzi's home in Watsonville, Calif.&nbsp;</p><p>A nine-hour standoff took place before Andrade officially surrendered to authorities. The Watsonville Police Department released a video of the arrest, and a statement on what transpired<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> via Instagram</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Jessie Andrade, 30, is now facing several charges, including felony criminal threats, brandishing of a firearm, felony burglary, violation of a domestic violence restraining order, and resisting/delaying his arrest," the Watsonville Police Department statement read.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to the statement, Andrade broke into Yoatzi's home in the early morning hours on Jan. 19. He allegedly "pointed a gun at her, their 4-year-old son, and his ex-girlfriend's father. The victims were able to safely leave the residence and call the police."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When officers arrived at the residence, Andrade refused to exit, and "crisis negotiators spent hours attempting to convince the suspect to surrender."</p><p>He did leave the house at around 10:30 a.m., and he was arrested upon his exit. Any subsequent updates on the case and the arrest have not been publicly shared at this time.&nbsp;Following the harrowing experience, Yoatzi released a statement on her Instagram stories on Jan. 20.</p><p>"Thank you all for all of the blessings, love, and support that is being sent to my family. Words can't explain how I felt during that moment, but I am beyond thankful that God and my grandparents in Heaven gave me the strength necessary to survive and protect my son. Your support means everything to me and my family during these crazy times," she wrote. "But we're all OK and things will get better..."</p><p>A day before the arrest, Yoatzi posted a video on YouTube and she discussed the relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The influencer hinted at her "toxic" breakup in her return to YouTube.</h2><p>Yoatzi never explicitly mentioned Andrade's name in her "I'M HEALING..." video, but she did discuss how tumultuous her recent breakup had gotten.</p><p>The 20-minute video was the first time that the vlogger had discussed her split at length, but she said that she wasn't going to divulge "crazy detail[s]" yet.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It's been a very difficult time for me," Yoatzi said at the beginning.</p><p>She shared that she considered making a video when everything first went down, but she realized that she wanted to wait until she was in a clear head space.&nbsp;</p><p>Yoatzi said people in her inner circle had been telling her to cut ties with her ex for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>"So many people told me to run a long time ago... I could probably fill up a book of people who would tell me to leave. I just wasn't strong enough to leave..." she said. "I really wasn't strong enough mentally or emotionally."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Though it took her a while to listen, she felt "proud" that she finally did.&nbsp;</p><p>"I am very, very proud of myself for finally getting out of a very, very toxic situation that I hope, one day, I can get to tell you guys about in detail," she continued. "Because it continues to be toxic. It's not easy to just walk away...
