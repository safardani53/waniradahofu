It's all been done! The grand public gestures, the flash mobs, the ring hidden in the cake, the intimate, candlelit dinner... It's hard to come up with a unique proposal these days. And more than being unique, it needs to speak to who you are as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>Edi Okoro was thinking about all of this when he was trying to figure out how to propose to his girlfriend, Cally. He carried around the ring for months waiting for the perfect moment. But he decided to have a little fun in the process, taking pics of the ring just out of Cally's view. Sometimes, he got so close I can't believe she didn't catch him. Edi posted these photos on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>, where they went totally viral because they are just about the cutest things you will ever see.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"You want to propose in a way that speaks to you as a person and couple," Edi wrote in the Facebook post that accompanies these hilarious pictures. "Some plan a flash mob, a fancy meal, or even arrange a marry me sign. I couldn't do this because 'Edi doesn't plan'... I'm a spontaneous improviser!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>He knew that if he planned something special, Cally would immediately catch on to what he was going to do. So he took the ring with him everywhere and waited for the right moment to pop the question.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>"After a month or so of waiting for the right moment," he wrote, "I was sitting on the sofa admiring 'my precious' (yes I became very attached to this ring by this point). Cally almost caught me staring at the ring, and it hit me! ... Cally doesn't know I have the ring!! I should just start documenting these moments!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And document he did. He started taking as many photos as he could of Cally and the ring without her noticing. It became a competition with himself, and honestly, he was totally winning. This is so silly and so adorable.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>And Cally remained clueless for a long time! He even left the ring in her jewelry plate for two days and she didn't see it. Edi really tried to put the ring right in front of her face...and she just had no idea it was there.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>How funny is this picture? This might be the best idea for a proposal I've ever heard. Because Edi hadn't been able to figure out the perfect moment to propose, he figured if he got caught, he'd just propose in that moment.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>He took the ring everywhere. To stores, on vacation, out to dinner... Everywhere. And Cally just went on living her life, none the wiser to the giant scheme Edi was pulling off behind her back.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>He took all these photos over the course of nearly a month spent constantly carrying the concealed ring. If I were Edi, I would be terrified of leaving the ring somewhere by accident or losing it somehow. But he managed to keep it safe through everything.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>There are several photos where I want to yell to Cally, "Turn around!" because she's so close to the ring! But she's just too distracted doing things like riding her bike...</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>...or carrying her bike upstairs to notice what's right in front of her. Edi told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bored Panda</a> that he met Cally in athletics. "We both competed at a very high level and traveled to competitions together... I knew she was the one after I realized our conversation didn't dry up and we bounced off each other."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I suspect is was partly Edi's competitive nature that inspired these hilarious photos. He seems to be competing with himself in every single one to get closer and closer to Cally without giving himself away.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The ones that he appears in are my favorite because his face is full of pure, unadulterated joy! You can just tell that he's having the time of his life pulling this fast one on his future wife.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Here, he probably told her to turn and pose for a picture, and she was clueless that her engagement ring was sitting right there on the table next to her. This is too funny and sweet.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Oh boy, that ring is getting mighty close to open water for my liking. What if she turned around quickly and he dropped it and the ring rolled into the ocean? Or what if a pelican or a seagull swooped down and picked it up?!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>I wonder what Cally was thinking here. She's busy trying to figure out where they're going, and Edi is having the time of his life snapping selfies. She probably could have used some help...</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Now I'm starting to question whether these could possibly be real. She's right there. He's right there. The ring is right there. It doesn't get much closer than that, folks.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Edi satsthere were a few close calls during this whole thing. "The binoculars," he said. "Only because she could have just looked up! Also, walking around with it in my pocket, I knocked into her a few times, [but] she didn't notice it was a box."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Here they are on the beach...a perfect, romantic spot for a proposal, don't you think? But Edi wasn't ready to pop the question just yet. He still had a few close-call pictures to take.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Including this one, which is such a close call that my heart is in my throat! I audibly gasped when I saw this pic. All she had to do was turn her head or put her arm up and she'd feel the ring!&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Last but not least, the sleeping beauty. It would actually be really adorable if she woke up with the ring in her hand and slowly figured out what was happening. Of course, that would rely on her waking up peacefully and not stretching out and losing the ring in the bed covers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Eventually, Edi actually proposed, and Cally said yes!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In a follow-up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook post</a>, Edi wrote, "So we did end up getting engaged, and no I didn't get caught...but how I did it is a story for another time. We took this photo not long after she said YES." Isn't that just the perfect ending to an adorable story? I can't wait for his update explaining how the proposal actually went down!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbalsMSnZJ6ml5a0prnEp6tmqpmjtG68x6irqKs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html&text=Guy%20Flaunted%20Engagement%20Ring%20in%20Front%20of%20Girlfriend%20for%20Months%20Without%20Her%20Knowing%20and%20Posted%20Hilari&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html&title=Guy%20Flaunted%20Engagement%20Ring%20in%20Front%20of%20Girlfriend%20for%20Months%20Without%20Her%20Knowing%20and%20Posted%20Hilari" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html&title=Guy%20Flaunted%20Engagement%20Ring%20in%20Front%20of%20Girlfriend%20for%20Months%20Without%20Her%20Knowing%20and%20Posted%20Hilari" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html&title=Guy%20Flaunted%20Engagement%20Ring%20in%20Front%20of%20Girlfriend%20for%20Months%20Without%20Her%20Knowing%20and%20Posted%20Hilari" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhidden-engagement-ring-photos.html&description=Guy%20Flaunted%20Engagement%20Ring%20in%20Front%20of%20Girlfriend%20for%20Months%20Without%20Her%20Knowing%20and%20Posted%20Hilari" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./is-cariad-lloyd-married-does-she-have-a-boyfriend-her-affairs-and-dating-history-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Cariad Lloyd married?
