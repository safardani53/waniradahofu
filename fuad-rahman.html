He does not, however, provide his exact birth date or location to anybody. However, we know that Fuad will be 43 years old in 2022. We believe he finished his education since, at the age of 18, he became engaged in drug traps and was arrested for the first time. He became a popular vocalist after being released from prison. He may have been unable to finish his college degree due to ups and downs in his life. His IQ, however, is comparable to that of a Ph.D. student. He creates tunes and lyrics that no one else has thought of.</p><h2>Fuad Rahman Height & Weight</h2><p><b>Fuad Rahman is 5 feet 7 inches tall</b><span>. He weighs approximately 60 kg. He has lovely warm black eyes and Black locks. There is no information on his chest-waist-hip measurements, dress size, shoe size, biceps, and so on.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Fuad-Rahman-1.jpg alt="Fuad Rahman" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Fuad Rahman’s Net Worth</h2><p><b>How much is Fuad Rahman’s net worth? </b>Fuad Rahman is now wealthy as one of the few Singapore musicians with such a large fan base. He has a million dollars. He does not simply make money from his music profession. However, he also owns a vehicle sales and purchasing company. He works at WnF Motoring & Credit Pte Ltd and makes a nice living there. His profits are substantial, but his true net worth is unknown to us. However, we estimate that this well-known musician has a net worth of $2 million USD as of August 2023.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Fuad Rahman’s popular songs include Bila Rindu, Kawan, Patah, and many more. His singing career started in the mid-2000s when he was named first runner-up in the talent program Anugerah. Satu, his debut album, remained a blockbuster in 2005. Then his second album, Inilah Aku, became viral. As his career progressed, he was pleased to be approached to sing with Daly Filsuf for the soundtrack of the play Anak Metropolitan 4.0. Eagle vision provided him with this chance. He took part in GV9 reality singing programs in 2022.</p><h2>Fuad Rahman Wife & Marriage</h2><p><b>Who is Fuad Rahman’s wife? </b>It may surprise you to learn that Fuad Rahman has been married three times in his life. He has three children from a previous marriage. His son, who is now 18 years old, is his oldest child. After his divorce from his wife, his son attempted to contact him for the first time by leaving a note for him at his auto sales firm, where Fuad formerly worked. That day was the happiest of Fuad’s life, as his son attempted to contact him.</p><p>His ex-wife and son’s mother are now happily married to someone else and enjoying a nice life. She later opens the doors to see Fuad and his children, and he now typically goes to meet his two children.</p><p>Siti Zulaiha is the name of Fuads’ second wife. She is a former flight attendant and a government worker. In 2022, he proposed to her and married her. But his life with Siti did not proceed as planned, and they split up. Fuad Rahman then met singer Tom, also known as Raja Farah Afzal Raja Ikram, who is currently 36 years old. They started dating, and Fuad divorced his wife Siti Zylaiha six months after they married on April 16, 2022. Tom and Fuad originally met when they competed in a singing contest many years ago.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGidrpmUYr%2BitMyapWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffuad-rahman.html&text=Fuad%20Rahman-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Ethnicity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffuad-rahman.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffuad-rahman.html&title=Fuad%20Rahman-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffuad-rahman.html&title=Fuad%20Rahman-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffuad-rahman.html&title=Fuad%20Rahman-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffuad-rahman.html&description=Fuad%20Rahman-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Wife%2c%20Ethnicity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./max-scherzer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Max Scherzer- Wiki, Age, Wife, Ethnicity, Net Worth, Height, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeremy-siegel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Jeremy Siegel net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
