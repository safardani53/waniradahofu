He’s been a household name since his Comedy Central&nbsp;series&nbsp;Chappelle’s Show&nbsp;debuted back in 2003. Prior to getting his own show, he starred in a handful of movies like&nbsp;The Nutty Professor, Robin Hood: Men In Tights,&nbsp;and many more. After stepping down from&nbsp;Chappelle’s Show,&nbsp;Dave, 49, took some time out of the spotlight, occasionally performing standup shows. He made a major comeback in 2017, releasing two specials on Netflix, and he’s been regularly putting out material since. Despite many fans welcoming his return, he’s also received much backlash for his material, including many jokes he’s made about transgender people.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Throughout the many phases of his career, there’s been one woman by his side:&nbsp;<strong>Elaine,&nbsp;</strong>48. While she’s a very private person, the comic’s wife has found her way into much of his standup material. She’s also occasionally accompanied her husband to different red carpet-events over the years. Despite many different highs and lows over the years, Elaine has been by his side.

He reflected on their history together during an interview on The Howard Stern Show. He revealed that she’s able to be upfront with him, even about the harder topics, because they’ve gone through so much. “She was with me when I was poor,” he said, via&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Parade</a>. “My wife, if it gets real bad, she’ll let me know, like, ‘Oh, you should look into this.’ But for the most part, I try not to pay attention to it because you don’t want to be careful as a comedian.”</p><h2>The couple have three children.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dave-Chappelle-wife-elaine-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Dave and Elaine are both loving parents to their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>three kids</a>. Their first son <strong>Sulayman&nbsp;</strong>was born around the time that they got married in 2001. Their second son&nbsp;<strong>Ibrahim&nbsp;</strong>was born in 2003, and their daughter&nbsp;<strong>Sanaa&nbsp;</strong>in 2009. The&nbsp;Equanimity&nbsp;comedian admitted that his kids helped him put his life into perspective. “Everything changed after I had children,” he said in a 2017 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>.&nbsp;“I took my professional life more seriously. And I think, as a dude, I had more depth after I had kids.”</p><h2>Elaine is a stay-at-home mom.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>While Dave travels the world as a comedian, it seems that Elaine mostly focuses on taking care of their family. Early on in their marriage, Dave admitted that sometimes she would travel with him when he had extended stays in different places in a 2001 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interview</a> with&nbsp;<strong>Howard Stern. </strong>“Sometimes, when I’m gigging, I’ll just be in a place for one night. Because we’ve got the baby, forget it man. She’s going to stay home, but if I’m in a place for a chunk of time, she’ll come meet me,” he said at the time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While both of their sons are young men, it’s not clear if more than 20 years later Elaine still follows the same idea. Their daughter is still a pre-teen. Dave has spoken about how glad his kids used to be to see him after a tour in one of his 2017 Netflix specials. “When my kids were little and the tour bus would pull up to the house, [they’d] spill out. ‘Dad is home, hooray!’ Then as the years went on, they’d get less interested. ‘Hey everybody, look: It’s Mr. Promises back from the road,'” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dave-Chappelle-wife-elaine-shutter-embed-3.jpg><h2>She used to want to be a professional chef.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Before they welcomed their first child, Elaine had her own creative pursuits: the culinary arts. While she may not have pursued a career in the service industry or as a celebrity chef, Dave has explained that his wife is still a master in the kitchen. “She doesn’t work as a professional chef, [but the kids] regularly eat like kings at home, thanks to her excellent culinary skills,” he said in a past&nbsp;interview, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Netline</a>.</p><h2>The pair moved to Ohio to raise their family.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While the two biggest comedy cities are often considered New York and Los Angeles, Dave chose to settle down somewhere a little different: Yellow Spring, Ohio. During COVID-19 pandemic, Dave turned his town to a bit of a comedy oasis, hosting outdoor shows for locals. He also filmed his thought-provoking special&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>8:46</a>,&nbsp;where he spoke about the death of&nbsp;<strong>George Floyd.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The Age of Spin comedian has said that he likes the small town, because it lets him detach from feeling like a major celebrity. “I’ll be reminded that I’m a celebrity here, but I don’t think about it at all until somebody asks me for a selfie or something,” he said in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS News</a>&nbsp;interview.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8OarZ5lk52usbzEpaOeZaees6Z5xKWYoqaVYoF5hZVvbmln</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html&text=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%20Marriage%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%20Marriage%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%20Marriage%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html&title=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%20Marriage%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdave-chappelle-wife-elaine-4896670.html&description=Everything%20To%20Know%20About%20His%20Marriage%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hannah-brown-revisits-bachelorette-windmill-days-on-vacation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hannah Brown Revisits Bachelorette Windmill Days on Vacation">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./eva-mendes-gold-ring-ryan-gosling-hike-two-daughters-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eva Mendes Spotted Wearing Gold Ring During Hike With Ryan Gosling  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
