Best design - <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Morphy Richards Microwave Accents Colour Collection</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/microvawe.jpg><ul><li><strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Morphy Richards Microwave Accents Colour Collection, £72.99 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>If you're looking for a solid stylish machine, you'll struggle to find much better than the Morphy Richards Microwave, especially for its price.</p><p>We love its 1950s style and, although red is our favourite, it's actually available in five colours.</p><p>Aside from looking cool, the Accents Microwave is also able to cook delicious meals with the press of a button thanks to its eight preset functions as well as its defrost option.</p><h2>12. Best for small kitchens - <span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Bosch Series 2 Freestanding Microwave</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Bosh-microwave.jpg><ul><li><strong><span id=productTitle class=a-size-large>Bosch Series 2 Freestanding Microwave, £149 from Amazon - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here</a></span></strong></li></ul><p>If you're looking for a compact microwave that is easy to use, this one should do the trick.</p><p>This freestanding microwave features five power levels and eight automatic programmes and a 24.5cm turntable, it's perfect for small kitchens.</p><p>The stainless steel interior can be wiped clean effortlessly and it also features a memory function as well as 99-minute timer, so you can relax whilst your food cooks.</p><h2>What should I look for in a new microwave?</h2><p>Cost shouldn't be your only consideration when buying a new microwave.</p><p>You'll also want to check things like capacity, as some models are good for re-heating small plates, but might not be able to handle larger dishes.</p><p>Power, measured in Watts (W), is also important as it dictates how quickly a microwave can heat food.</p><p>It's also useful to have a large viewing window on your microwave so you can check on the progress of your meal without opening it up.</p><h2>What are the best microwave features?</h2><p>As well as the basics, you'll want to make sure your new microwave has features that work for you.</p><p>Programmes that calculates defrosting times based on weight and ingredients are common and useful.</p><p>It's a good idea to examine a microwave before you purchase as well to make sure you can get on with the buttons and mechanisms.</p><p>It's also worth familiarising yourself with the manual of a new microwave, otherwise you might end up missing out on features you never knew your microwave had.</p><h2>What other types of microwave are there?</h2><p>There are a number of types of microwave available to purchase alongside traditional, standalone rotating microwaves.</p><p>Flatbed microwaves don't have a rotating element, so you can fit even more inside them, although they tend to be more expensive.</p><p>Also, you can buy a variety of built-in microwaves for your kitchen, although these tend to be more expensive than other models and require fitting.</p><h2>How to clean a microwave</h2><p>There are plenty of natural ways to clean a microwave, without resorting to heavy chemicals.</p><p>The acidity of white vinegar makes it a great cleaning choice for softening and tackling stains and dried food. Simply add two tablespoons to a microwavable jug or bowl along with water, and pop it into the microwave until the water begins to boil. Once it's boiled, leave the jug or bowl in the microwave for a couple of minutes to allow it to steam. This will loosen the food and grime, and you can then tackle the cleaning easily with a cloth or sponge.</p><p>You can also do the same by adding half a lemon to the water (great for adding a fresh scent), or two tablespoons of baking soda to help eliminate odours.</p><h2>What is the best microwave brand?</h2><p>There are some really strong contenders out there for microwaves. We rate Morphy Richards, Russell Hobbs, Panasonic and Bosch.</p><h2>What is the best microwave to buy?</h2><p>Honestly, there's no definitive answer. It all depends on the specifications you're after; whether you want something cheap and basic or a combination microwave with all the bells and whistles. There are some great options out there for every budget. Priced at £54.99 from Argos, the Cookworks 700W microwave is the cheapest of our picks and offers great value, along with more than 5,000 satisfied customer reviews.</p><p>Meanwhile, we've crowned the Panasonic NN-CD87KSBPQ our best overall microwave thanks to its massive 34-litre capacity, 1,000W power and grill and oven function.</p><h2>Where to buy a microwave</h2><p>Head to the likes of Argos, Currys, AO, and John Lewis, which all have an extensive selection. You can also try supermarkets like Aldi, Tesco and ASDA which also all offer own-brand options that can be really affordable and well-performing.</p><h2>How does a microwave work?</h2><p>Microwaves heat and cook food by exposing it to – you guessed it – microwaves, which is essentially electromagnetic radiation transmitted in waves or particles. The waves are absorbed by the food's water molecules, which heat up thanks to the electric field of the microwave which causes the molecules to rotate and rub against each other.</p><h2>Can you put metal in the microwave?</h2><p>It's best to avoid putting any metal in the microwave: the <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class=hgKElc>metal reflects the microwaves instead of absorbing them, which can cause a fire hazard.</span></span></p><h2>How to make scrambled eggs in the microwave</h2><p>Believe it or not, some people swear by making their scrambled eggs in the microwave!</p><p>Simply crack the eggs into a microwavable bowl, add a splash of milk and season with salt and pepper. Whisk it up just like you would if you were adding them to the pan and then microwave for 30 seconds, before stirring with a fork.</p><p>If the eggs still need to scramble some more, just microwave them for additional 10-second bursts until you're satisfied (and remember they'll continue to cook for a bit once you take them out). Simple!</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Top stories in Sun Selects home</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our pick of the best microwaves?
