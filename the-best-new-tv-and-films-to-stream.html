But don’t worry, because good things do indeed come to those willing to wait. Ginger (voiced this time by Thandiwe Newton) is living happily in an island bird sanctuary with Rocky (Zachary Levi), their new daughter Molly (Bella Ramsey) and the rest of the flock. However, when Molly decides that she wants to spread her wings and explore the mainland, only to be caught and whisked off to a terrifying new chicken farm, Ginger and the gang plot a daring rescue. Lovingly, painstakingly put together with the usual Aardman Animations brilliance, it’s joyous, funny, smart and moving, and guaranteed to put a smile on the face of the whole family. Fingers crossed we don’t have to wait another 23 years for the <span id=39f97f61-3702-4188-9c8a-71b7b3bb19d3 class=suggested-link>next</span> one.</p><p><strong><strong>Under Pressure: The U.S. Women’s World Cup Team</strong></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Available from Tuesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/u-s-womens-world-cup-860349266.png><p>The thrilling recent successes of England’s Lionesses have helped the nation fall in love with the squad. But for the US women’s team, the most decorated in football <span id=2fb44707-2f44-457d-93e3-2d3496d5c269 class=suggested-link>history</span>, success is expected - anything less is considered a failure. As a result, there was a whole heap of pressure hanging over them at this year’s Women’s World Cup, a tournament that didn’t quite go to plan and has led to the resignation of Vlatko Andonovski, who’ll be replaced by <a href=#>Chelsea</a> manager <a href=#>Emma Hayes</a>. This new four-part documentary series follows the US squad before and during the tournament, talking to players and coaching staff, and painting an eye-opening picture of the issues they have to deal with both on and off the pitch.</p><p><strong><strong>Kevin Hart & Chris Rock: Headliners Only</strong></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Available from Monday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/host-chris-rock-actor-kevin-860351079.jpg><p>“This is a story about two separate journeys that somehow align and end up at the same intersection at the top,” says <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a>, explaining the idea behind this documentary that captures him and fellow comic Chris Rock at the height of their powers. Last <span id=a5984b19-6132-4786-8915-7d19a620ee34 class=suggested-link>summer</span>, the two stars performed four sold-out co-headline shows in New York, and we join them backstage as they prepare for the performances. They also take the opportunity to talk about the long, eventful and sometimes tough journeys that brought them to where they are today. An inspiring, hilarious glimpse into the lives of two comedy kings.</p><p><strong><strong>Singles Inferno</strong></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Available from Tuesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000860348622.jpg><p>The hugely popular Korean dating show is back for a third season, and this time the Inferno is bigger, hotter and more bingeable than ever. If you’ve not seen it before, the show takes a group of hot singletons, maroons them on an island – the Inferno - and gives them tough challenges designed to help them pair up. Should they form a couple, they get to have a date in Paradise: a super- luxurious island where they’ll be pampered and, hopefully, cement their bond. Like before, this season is hosted by singer Kyuhyun, actress Lee Da-Hee and comedian Hong Jin-Kyung. And to add to the fun, this time they’ll be joined by season two star DEX, who also turned up in madcap reality challenge show Zombieverse.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Streaming</h2></p><p><strong><strong><strong>Face To Face With ETA: Conversations With A Terrorist</strong></strong></strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000860349022.jpg><p>The ETA – Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, meaning ‘Basque Homeland and Liberty’ - was a separatist movement that used terrorism in the hope of securing independence for the Basque region of <span id=cf0b477e-0320-45ca-aa43-e052af02fc88 class=suggested-link>Spain</span>. In this powerful <span id=bbdf8300-51d6-413a-b256-3f192eeaaba4 class=suggested-link>film</span>, one of the leading figures in the organisation, Josu Urrutikoetxea - also known as Josu Ternera - speaks at length to director Jordi Évole about ETA and some of its most controversial, destructive and violent actions. It’s not an easy watch - and Urrutikoetxea is a divisive figure, to say the least - but the film is at least shown to bring some answers to one man who was caught up in one of ETA’s attacks. In Spanish with subtitles.</p><p><strong>Carol & The End Of The World</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000860351361.jpg><p>There are so many adult animations out there, all promising darkly funny, irreverent entertainment, that it can feel bewildering trying to pick one to devote your time to. But the knowledge that this 10-part series has been created by Dan Guterman, whose writing credits include Rick And Morty, Community and The Colbert Report, means it’s definitely one worth checking out. When it’s revealed that a mysterious planet is hurtling towards Earth, promising extinction for humankind, most people decide to cut loose and pursue their wildest dreams. Carole, however, does not. Instead, this quiet and uncomfortable woman (voiced by Martha Kelly) prefers to find comfort in her daily routine – but will everyone else let her?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>DISNEY+</strong></h2><p><strong>Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/indiana-jones-dial-destiny-861112850.jpg><p>The release of the fifth - and final - Indiana Jones film was one of the movie events of this year, and now Disney+ subscribers can enjoy this last action-packed adventure for the daredevil archaeologist adventurer. It’s 1969 and an elderly Indy (Harrison Ford) and his estranged goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge) set out to track down a powerful and ancient machine that can allow time travel, before shady former Nazi scientist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) does. Dripping with nostalgia and powered by typically inventive action sequences, it’s a worthy way for our hero to sign off. Fans should also look out for new documentary (Disney+ Friday), which tells the story of the creation of the classic character and explores the making of all five Indiana Jones films.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>PARAMOUNT+</strong></h2><p><strong>The Serial Killer’s Wife</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jack-farthing-beth-played-annabel-861113733.jpg><p>As that title makes clear, this four-part psychological thriller isn’t a bundle of laughs - but it keep you perched perilously close to the edge of your sofa. Beth Fairchild (Annabel Scholey) appears to have the perfect life - a lovely family home in an idyllic village, and a husband, Tom (Jack Farthing), who, as the local doctor, is much respected and liked. Indeed, he’s so well-loved, when his birthday rolls round, Beth organises a secret party and invites most of the village. However, Beth’s world implodes when the party is interrupted by the <span id=ddb3a593-3a1f-48f9-ba8a-2dcfe0cad67b class=suggested-link>police</span>, who arrest Tom for the murder of his former assistant. Initially believing Tom to be innocent, Beth starts to waver when she confides in his best childhood friend Adam (Luke Treadaway), leading to new revelations… Compelling.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>APPLE TV+</strong></h2><p><strong>The Family Plan</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861115936.jpg><p>There’s no shortage of movies or shows about secret assassins or spies trying - but usually failing - to live normal lives. The Family Plan is another, but fortunately it’s a worthy, one-liner filled addition to the growing list. Devoted dad and car salesman Dan (Mark Wahlberg) loves his quiet life with wife Jessica (Michelle Monaghan) and their three children. However, Dan has been keeping a secret from them all: he used to be an elite government assassin. And when dangerous enemies from his past track him down, he springs a ‘surprise’ road trip to Las Vegas on his family, hoping to stay one step ahead of the bad guys. Can this rusty former agent neutralise this deadly new threat and keep both his family and his secret safe? Fast-paced and funny, it’s perfect popcorn movie entertainment.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>PRIME VIDEO</strong></h2><p><strong>Reacher</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861115867.jpg><p>Bad guys beware because, following an excellent first series, super-tough former military police investigator Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson) is back and ready to dish out some typically rough justice. This season, when Jack receives a shock message that members of his former US <span id=4dda9f7d-7397-444f-a583-ed6ac90f063c class=suggested-link>army</span> unit are being bumped off by an unknown adversary, he unites with some of his former colleagues - including Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), who we met in the first series, and forensic accountant Karla Dixon (Serinda Swan) - to investigate. Together, they try to uncover who is behind the murders, and to stop the killer before he or she <span id=f14cb58e-a0e8-4655-ba88-57a76c67cf04 class=suggested-link>strikes</span> again. But has Reacher bitten off more than even he can chew?</p><p><strong>Los Farad</strong> - Available from Tuesday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861116021.jpg><p>Miguel Herrán, who’s probably best known on these shores for playing Rio in the brilliant <span id=7a4d3268-d1ac-4aeb-b796-aa23b1835d08 class=suggested-link>Money</span> Heist, stars in this slick Spanish thriller. Set in the 80s, in Marbella, the eight-part series centres around Oskar (Miguel), whose biggest wish in life is to own and run his own gym. His dream looks like becoming a reality when he meets the influential Sara Farad (Susana Farad) and her family, and the Costa del Sol becomes his oyster. But before long, Oskar finds himself being drawn into a hugely dangerous hobby, the world of arms trafficking.

This documentary provides a similar thrill, examining the falling-out between the family of Brooklyn Beckham’s wife <a href=#>Nicola Peltz</a> and the wedding planners hired to arrange the young couple’s lavish 2022 nuptials in Miami. Months after the big day, which cost a reported $5.2million, the bride’s billionaire father sued the planners - Nicole Braghin and Arianna Grijalba - for so called “mistakes”. But was that fair? Or was it more a case of an over-demanding, over-privileged <span id=4ee528c9-029d-49ae-b6db-f98f1b1277fa class=suggested-link>celebrity</span> client? Examining the legal battle from both sides, and featuring plenty of cringe-worthy evidence featured in the trial, the show will help you make up your own mind.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>HAYU</strong></h2><p><strong>The <span id=309c3a73-f0c0-4573-9758-9b575db79ca1 class=suggested-link>Real Housewives</span> Ultimate Girls Trip</strong> - Available from Friday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000861119845.jpg><p>The decision last year to completely refresh the cast of The Real Housewives Of New York City didn’t go down well with everyone - particularly the original wives themselves. But you can’t keep a good cast down and, excitingly, the new series of Ultimate Girls Trip reunites some of the best-loved wives from the show’s storied, glamorous past. Jetting off to St. Barts for what’s sure to be an epic, feisty and fabulous series are Kelly Killoren Bensimon, Luann de Lesseps, Dorinda Medley, <a href=#>Sonja Morgan</a>, <a href=#>Ramona Singer</a> and Kristen Taekman. It’s sure to prompt some flashbacks for Sonja, Luann and Ramona, as they’ll be staying in the same house where the trio holidayed during season five of the main show. Will Luann bump into that hot pirate Tomas she was famously linked to last time they were there? We can but hope.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>ACORN TV</strong></h2><p><strong>Candice Renoir</strong> - Available from Monday</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/photo-credit-fabien-malot-acorntv-861139651.jpg><p>Clever but unconventional French detective Candice is a whizz at solving bizarre murder cases.
