She mostly played for the Phoenix Mercury of the Woman’s National Basketball Association, during her 19year career where she won three championships. She also played for Australia’s national team winning two Olympic medals and leading Australian Opals to a gold medal at the World Championship. For this, she received the MVP honors of the tournament</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-901 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Penny Taylor marriage with Rodrigo Rodrigues Gil</h2><p>Penny Taylor was married to Brazilian volleyball player Rodrigo Rodrigues Gil. Rodrigo is a professional Olympic volleyball player who plays for Brazil and for Pauda in the Italian league of Volleyball. Taylor met Gil,&nbsp;initially&nbsp;in Italy in March 2004 when Penny was playing for Familia Schio and Gil&nbsp;was playing for Pauda.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>&nbsp;Her boyfriend Gil did not speak English and Penny did not speak a word of Portuguese, but they both spoke Italian, which became the language that bought them together, and later her soon-to-be husband learned English and Taylor learned Portuguese to be able to communicate with his family.</p><p>Taylor and Gill got married on December 29th, 2005, a year after they met. They tied the knot in Schio, Italy. Two days before their wedding, it had been snowing non-stop, but the sun decided to come out and give them the gift on the day of their wedding.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-120 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-910 data-method=placement-service></span><p></p><p>They tied the knot in front of their whole friends and family in a 400-year-old theatre building and the reception took place in a beautiful villa built-in 1540. Both their family flew from their respective home countries to attend their wedding. Taylor’s sister Heather and her best friend Hayley were her bridesmaids and Gill’s brother Marcello and his friend Giba were his groomsmen. The married couple didn’t go on a honeymoon until a year later due to their hectic schedule. When they finally decide to go on one, they flew to Australia.</p><h2>Penny's divorce with Gil</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Penny Taylor and Rodrigo Rodrigues Gill were married for 3 three years before calling it quits. The reason for the divorce has not been clear but they were rumors of her having an affair with her teammate during her marriage. But she has declined those rumors.</p><h2>Is she single now?</h2><p>After her divorce, there were speculations of her being a lesbian and dating her teammate <a href=#>Diana Taurasi</a>. Diana and Penny both played for Phoenix Mercury.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-117 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-911 data-method=placement-service></span><p>The rumors sparked when Taurasi posted a picture of her and Taylor on her Instagram page. Penny went as her date for the ESPY Award. And when pictures of them surfaced on various occasions outside the basketball court put fuel in the fire. In an obituary for Denna Noble, Penny’s mother, Diana was included as Daughter in law.</p><p>&nbsp;Whether they are together or not, but in the court, they worked extremely well together, in 2007 Taylor together with Cappie Pondexter and Diana Taurasi led her team to the championship of the WNBA.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>But neither of them has denied or accepted the rumors as of yet. So the answer to the question is Penny Taylor single is still unknown.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Also See: <a href=#>Diana Taurasi Personal Life and Relationship</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FSrZirnJ%2Bie6S7zGicsWWno6%2Biec%2BepaexXamuurjOq2SmmaKntqKzxGaYp5xdmba3u9GcnGavmam1br7Onamin59iv7Cw0aKerp2qYrSquIyiqmarmJp6tLXNoKOeZZ6kxA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html&text=Ex-WNBA%20Penny%20Taylor%20marriage%20and%20divorce%20with%20Rodrigo%20Rodriguez%20Gil.%20Is%20she%20single%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html&title=Ex-WNBA%20Penny%20Taylor%20marriage%20and%20divorce%20with%20Rodrigo%20Rodriguez%20Gil.%20Is%20she%20single%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html&title=Ex-WNBA%20Penny%20Taylor%20marriage%20and%20divorce%20with%20Rodrigo%20Rodriguez%20Gil.%20Is%20she%20single%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html&title=Ex-WNBA%20Penny%20Taylor%20marriage%20and%20divorce%20with%20Rodrigo%20Rodriguez%20Gil.%20Is%20she%20single%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fex-wnba-penny-taylor-marriage-and-divorce-with-rodrigo-rodriguez-gil-is-she-single-now.html&description=Ex-WNBA%20Penny%20Taylor%20marriage%20and%20divorce%20with%20Rodrigo%20Rodriguez%20Gil.%20Is%20she%20single%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./greg-mathis-19600405-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Greg Mathis (Reality Star) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alex-price.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alex Price">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
