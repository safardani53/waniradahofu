The air ambulance came over twice.</p><p>“I’ve been told the father of the kids is offshore just now. It’s heartbreaking to think what the family must be going through.”</p><p>Witnesses say Dionne was sent flying 30ft through the air while little Harlow and her brother Leon were thrown&nbsp;over a wall by the impact.</p><p>It is believed the 23-year-old driver who hit them was overtaking a line of cars at speed when he clipped one and ploughed into the kids, the <a href=#>Daily Record</a> reports.</p><p>Safety campaigner Dave Mason, 60, said the 30mph spot where they were hit is plagued by speeding drivers.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Related Stories</h2></p><p>He said: “That road is a death trap. I came home 20 minutes after the crash and the road was blocked off.</p><p>“There’s a playpark there and a primary school round the corner. The same thing happened in the next village when a child was killed on a bike 20 years ago.”</p><p>SNP councillor Alan Grant said: “My heart goes out to the family.”</p><p>He added: “You can put in speed limits but it won’t change how people who cause these accidents drive.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/nintchdbpict000274772107.jpg><p>Harlow’s mum Sara, 36, and dad Steven, 39, have two other children, Reo, nine, and McKenzie, 13.</p><p>The tragedy comes 11 years after the children’s gran Elizabeth Haxton died in a car accident aged 42.</p><p>Harlow's middle name was Elizabeth in honour of her granny.</p><p>Sara posted on Facebook before Harlow’s birth: “Had a dream about my mum last night, she told me I was going to have one more baby (a girl) after I finished uni!”</p><p>Floral tributes and toys were left at the scene on the A94 as cops probed the crash.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Coupar Angus Primary school could not comment last night.</p><p>Deputy First Minister John Swinney, the MSP for Perthshire North, said: “I am devastated to hear of the tragedy that has happened at Larghan Park in Coupar Angus.</p><p>“I extend my deepest sympathies to the family of Harlow and hope for the recovery of the other children affected.</p><p>“This is a terrible event.
