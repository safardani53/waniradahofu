What fans may not be too familiar with is the super star’s love life.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In addition to dating numerous famous men, Laura was once married to musician&nbsp;<strong>Ben Harper</strong>. Below we break down all you need to know about the rocker and his eight-year marriage to Laura, including how they met, the details of their family life, and where they stand today.</p><h2>He’s A Musician</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Born in Pomona, California on Oct. 28, 1969, <strong>Benjamin</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Charles Harper&nbsp;</strong>began playing guitar and regularly hung out at his maternal grandparents’ music store, called the Folk Music Center and Museum. Moreover, in 1978, he attended a&nbsp;<strong>Bob Marley&nbsp;</strong>concert and noted it to be a pivotal moment for him to be inspired to take on music.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The multi-talented singer and guitar player released his first album,<span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>Welcome to the Cruel World</span></i><span>, in 1994 under Virgin Records. He subsequently dropped 14 more successful albums in the following years, also having his music featured on numerous television shows like&nbsp;</span><i><span>Vampire Diaries</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>One Tree Hill</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>House</span></i><span>. He still plays music today and continues to release albums.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8><span>In addition to his music career, Ben co-owns the skateboarding brand Roller Horror. He’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>been interviewed</a> about his experience trying out new tricks and learning the sport at an older age.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>He & Laura Were Married For Eight Years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Laura-Derns-Ex-Husband-ss-2-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Ben and Laura met back in fall 2000 when Laura attended one of his concerts, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. They hit it off immediately and eventually began dating, officially tying the knot in 2005 in an intimate ceremony at their home.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Their relationship didn’t last, however, as Ben filed for divorce in 2010 citing “irreconcilable differences” and they were reported to have separated by January of that year, per&nbsp;TMZ.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>The pair actually ended up reconciling in 2012 before Laura could file a response to the divorce filing, even showing up to the 2012 Golden Globes together. The divorce was finalized in 2013, however, and they both went their separate ways.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Ben and Laura were notoriously private about their relationship, making some red carpet appearances together here and there, but ultimately keeping out the public eye. Laura did, however, make a rare mention of her divorce back in 2020, speaking with&nbsp;Variety&nbsp;about how the experience impacted her award-winning performance in Netflix’s Marriage Story.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><span>“As [director <strong>Noah Baumbach</strong>] first said about the story when we first talked about it, he said, ‘I want to tell a love story where endings are not failures.’ And that really moved me and struck me deeply,” </span><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><span>she said</span></a><span>, noting her own amicable separation from Ben, as well as her own parents’ separation.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><span>“So to my amazing divorced parents, and my amazing step parents, and my amazing children—who came from love despite an ending in a marriage—we’re so privileged to redefine what family looks like.”</span></p><h2>Do They Have Any Children Together?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>During their partnership, the couple welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two children together</a>, a son <strong>Ellery</strong>, born in 2001, and a daughter&nbsp;<strong>Jaya</strong>, born in 2004.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Ellery began a modeling career as a teen, walking in a Calvin Klein show in 2018.One of the highlights of the then-teen model’s outfit was a graduation cap, but Ellery wouldn’t celebrate&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his real graduation</a>&nbsp;until May 2020, when his mom posted a photo of him in a cap and gown.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Jaya is following in her mother’s footsteps as an actress, making her debut in the 2021 film&nbsp;Teenage Emotions. In addition to acting, <span>Laura has also spoken about how she shares politics with her kids. “I focus on what I’ve decided is this country and the country that I describe to my children. And there are very few things that seem clear, but there is zero tolerance for a few things, because we’re Americans, and we’re clear about a few things: Nazis, racists, people who denounce people based on their cultural or religious or sexual preference — like that doesn’t fly in this country,” she told </span>WWD&nbsp;<span>in August 2017.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-20><span>Since her split from Ben, the Wild</span><span>&nbsp;star has shared insight about what it’s like being a single mom in Hollywood.</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-21><span>“The more I learn about my mistakes as a mother, the deeper I enjoy how fully I love my children,” Laura said during a May 2019 interview with </span><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><i><span>InStyle</span></i></a><span>. “Because I can let them know I really screw up sometimes. I hide from blame in a lot of areas in my life, but I’m trying not to do that as a mom. This is the first time in my life that I am being ambitious because I am a single parent.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-22>She’s also opened up about having hard conversations with her two teens.&nbsp;She recalled hearing her kids talking about their peers vaping and asking her questions about its safety in an August 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Romper</a>.&nbsp;“As a parent we don’t always understand that that’s what happening until we have an almost-20 year old who tells us years later ‘I was&nbsp;asking&nbsp;because I was curious and I needed to have some guidance,’” she said, before speaking about her parenting style. “Giving them room to be&nbsp;treated in a very adult way&nbsp;has helped me stay open to how much they teach me each day.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8uarKuZXZmys7qMnq9moKWor6K6w2ZrcG5kZYJ0ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html&text=All%20About%20Her%208-Year%20Marriage%20To%20Ben%20Harper%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html&title=All%20About%20Her%208-Year%20Marriage%20To%20Ben%20Harper%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html&title=All%20About%20Her%208-Year%20Marriage%20To%20Ben%20Harper%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html&title=All%20About%20Her%208-Year%20Marriage%20To%20Ben%20Harper%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flaura-dern-ex-husband-4764053.html&description=All%20About%20Her%208-Year%20Marriage%20To%20Ben%20Harper%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anzu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anzujaama- Age, Height, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Ethnicity">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-happened-to-christina-and-henry-from-married-at-first-sight-season-11.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  What happened to Christina and Henry from Married at First Sight season 11?
