Moore-Martin</a> was 81 years old when she first met <a href=#>Ben Field</a>, who was in his twenties, in November 2014.</p><p>Despite the age gap, the pair began a romantic relationship.</p><p>When they met, Ann did not know that her new lover had murdered her neighbour months earlier.</p><p>Their relationship grew serious, with Ben often staying in Ann's house.</p><p>Ann had been considering moving to be nearer her family, but due to Ben's manipulative behaviour, she began to isolate herself from her relatives.</p><p>In August 2016, Ben told Ann that his brother was seriously ill and that for him to continue his studies and living at <a href=#>Cambridge University</a> he needed a dialysis machine.</p><p>This was all a lie.</p><p>Ann cashed in some bonds to around £27,700 and gave it to Ben for his brother.</p><p>By November 2016, Ben's tactics to get her to change her will became more extreme.</p><p>He began writing messages from 'God' on her mirrors, eventually telling her to leave her house to Ben instead of her niece.</p><p>Sadly, Ann believed the messages were real and changed her will to include Ben as a beneficiary.</p><p>Ann became unwell toward the end of 2016 and continued to deteriorate into the new year.</p><p>She ended up in the <a href=#>hospital</a> on February 4, 2017, after suffering a seizure.</p><p>Ann's niece contacted Thames Valley Police and informed them that she believed Ben was manipulating her aunt into changing her will.</p><p>This prompted officers to begin investigating where they discovered Ben's link to Ann and Peter.</p><p>Ann realised she was being conned by Ben and ceased all contact with him and also removed him from her will.</p><p>Ann died of natural causes in May 2017, aged 83 years old.</p><h2>How did Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore Martin meet Ben Field?</h2><p>Ben met his first victim <a href=#>Peter</a> while Peter was working as a guest lecturer at the University of Buckingham.</p><p>The pair even had a betrothal ceremony at their parish church in 2014.</p><p>That same year, Peter changed his will to include Ben, leaving his half of his house and a sum of money to Ben.</p><p>He also appointed Ben his literary agent.</p><p>Ann Moore-Martin was Peter's neighbour, and <a href=#>police who found Ben's list of 100 elderly 'clients'</a> believed he was plotting to kill them all.</p><p>The list included Ben's parents, grandparents and brother.</p><h2>What happened to Peter Farquhar?</h2><p><a href=#>Peter</a> and Ben entered into a romantic relationship in 2014.</p><p>Over the course of their relationship, Ben manipulated Peter into changing his will to make him a beneficiary.</p><p>Their relationship came to a tragic end when <a href=#>Peter was discovered dead in his home</a> on October 26, 2015.</p><p>His death was not initially believed to be suspicious, but the passing of his neighbour Ann Moore-Martin a couple of months later launched a homicide inquiry that resulted in the arrest and conviction of Ben.</p><p>Ben made Peter believe he was going insane.</p><p>According to The Sun, Ben spiked Peter's food with hallucinogenic party drug 2-CB and sedatives.</p><p>To add insult to injury, Ben filmed harrowing footage of Peter to convince doctors that Peter had dementia.</p><p>Peter also had his drinks spiked with pure alcohol, leading to loved ones believing he was an alcoholic.</p><p>Ben's evil actions towards Peter concluded with him suffocating him and then staging it to look like he had drunk himself to death.</p><p>During his trial,&nbsp;<a href=#>Field admitted to drugging Farquhar with benzodiazepines and hallucinogens</a>&nbsp;simply to "torment" him, telling the jury that he did it "for no other reason other than it was cruel, to upset and torment Peter – purely out of meanness".</p><h2>Where is Ben Field now?</h2><p>As of July 2023, Ben Field is in <a href=#>prison</a>.</p><p>Four years after Peter's death Ben was jailed for life with a minimum of 36 years after being found guilty of Peter's murder at <a href=#>Oxford</a> Crown Court.</p><p>Police called Ben a psychopath and said he would have posed an "ongoing danger to society" had he not been stopped.</p><p>Ben first appealed his conviction in 2021 which was subsequently dismissed.</p><p>His last bid to have his conviction overturned was in January 2022, which was also unsuccessful.</p><p class=postsid
