Some people are good with children. Others are not. It is a gift.</p><p>“You either have it or you don’t. My father didn’t. I can only guess that although I might not have missed my mother and would certainly not have missed my father, I would have missed Nanny most desolately.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354027994.jpg><p>At ten he was sent to boarding school, by now furious that his childhood was public property.</p><p>The constant taunts at Stowe School in Buckinghamshire were a source of “toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment”.</p><p>And it got worse. When he was little Christopher had been recorded reciting several of the poems, and once the record surfaced in Stowe his bullies played it repeatedly.</p><p>Christopher, played by child actor Will Tilston in the film, later recalled: “Eventually the joke, if not the record, wore out and they handed it to me. I took it and broke it into a hundred fragments and scattered them over a distant field.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354028899.jpg><p>He never forgave his father, who he said had “filched from me my good name and had left me with nothing but the empty fame of being his son”.</p><p>By adulthood, Christopher only communicated with his parents via letter and refused to see them.</p><p>Meanwhile, his father gave away the original Winnie-the-Pooh toy bear and his stuffed friends Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Kanga, which had all belonged to Christopher.</p><p>They had been in the living room of the writer’s home until an American publisher asked to borrow them in 1947. No one asked for them back and they gathered dust in a box in a New York office for decades.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000001069605.jpg><p>The rights to Winnie-the-Pooh were partially sold to Disney in 1961 and handed over completely in 2001 for £240millionMaking family life even trickier, Christopher fell in love with his first cousin, Daphne’s niece Lesley de Selincourt.</p><p>To the disgust of his parents, the pair married in 1948 and their only daughter Clare was born with cerebral palsy, suffering disabilities which left her confined to a wheelchair.</p><p>Daphne was heartbroken, and matters were made worse still when Christopher gave a damning interview blasting his parents for neglect and calling them cold and detached.</p><p>Horrified Daphne was so angry she ordered staff to dig a deep hole in the grounds of their home to bury a sculpture of Christopher so she would never have to lay eyes on it again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000353145657.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000354084337.jpg><p>Milne died in January 1956, aged 74.

Even on her deathbed she refused to see him.</p><p>The family’s six-bedroomed home, Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, East Sussex, was sold to Rolling Stone Brian Jones, who was found dead in its swimming pool in 1969.</p><p>Christopher, meanwhile, had grudgingly accepted a share of his father’s legacy even though he hated the idea of taking a “lift from my fictional namesake of all people”. But he relented “for Clare’s sake”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000353145709.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000353145680.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000353145713.jpg><p>He later sold half his share in the future royalties for just £150,000 to the Royal Literary Fund and ploughed the cash into care for his daughter.</p><p>He and wife Lesley ran a small bookshop in Dartmouth, Devon, for more than 20 years until his death, aged 75, in 1996.</p><h3><a href=#>SNEAK PEAK <span>Here's the first glimpse of stars Domhnall Gleeson and Margot Robbie in upcoming A.A.
