Leal also has another source of income and that is his real estate career.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Indiana Hoosier’s senior Anthony Leal was a Bloomington Herald Times Player of the Year during high school. But his collegiate basketball career never took off.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anthony-leal-contract.jpg><p>In his junior year, Leal played only 11 games. Born and raised in Bloomington, Anthony’s parents, Sherry and Martin Leal, are part of the Indiana University Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>But on Tuesday night against Iowa, Anthony made a mark, scoring a career-high 13 points. Leal has acknowledged his less playing time and has said it doesn’t matter if he plays one or 40 minutes.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anthony Leal Net Worth 2024</h2><p>The college basketball player Anthony Leal’s net worth might be around the six-figure mark. Since 2021, when the NCAA allowed college athletes to earn endorsement money, many benefited, and one of them happened to be Anthony.&nbsp;</p><p>Right off the bet, Anthony signed a deal with the Barstool Athletics. The Barstool Athletics Twitter page welcomed the Indiana basketball player.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his NIL deals as stated by the On3 page, is that with Mother Bear Pizza.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anthony-leal-nil-deal.jpg><p>An X user, Jared Kelly, tweeted that Anthony has made a NIL deal with Mother Bear’s Pizza in Bloomington. It was also reported that Leal had his own meal called, The Leal Deal, on the menu that included ten boneless wings and cheesy bread.</p><p>Last month, the basketball player announced another NIL deal on his Instagram page. He partnered with Granite Student Living, a property management company in Indiana.&nbsp;</p><p>In the caption of his post, Leal wrote he had teamed up with Granite Student Living, and those who sign a lease with them and provide the code Leal#3 when signing their lease will receive a $50 gift card.&nbsp;</p><p>One of his other NIL deals is environment-friendly. The Indiana basketball player teamed up with Go Bloomington. Their mission is to help people find better alternatives and reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>He is also part of the Project 44 initiative, created in memory of former Butler center Andrew Smith.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;Anthony Leal Real Estate Career&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Leal announced one of his NIL deals in 2022. It happened to be with Millican Realty, with whom he is also pursuing his real estate agent career.&nbsp;</p><p>Leal is completing his MBA from Indiana University, so it seems to be a role and advert perfect for him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anthony-leal-real-estate.jpg><p>But with his basketball career now almost over, Leal is focusing on his real estate career. In one of his interviews, Leal said he had sold about a dozen homes.</p><p>Anthony graduated from the Kelley School of Business in 3½ years and is now focused on his Master’s.&nbsp;</p><h2>Anthony Leal Touching Gesture For His Sister</h2><p>In 2022, Anthony Leal used his NIL money to pay off his sister Lauren’s college debt. Like her brother, Lauren too played basketball. She was part of the DePauw University in Greencastle.&nbsp;</p><p>In a video uploaded on X (formerly Twitter), the Leal family could be seen opening their Christmas gifts, and then it was Lauren’s turn.</p><p>Anthony handed Lauren a card that read, “You’re a spark of goodness brought into the world. You radiate kindness and bring happiness to so many people, especially me.”</p><p>I wanted to know how much I look up to you and admire you. Your soul is beautiful, and you are the best role model ever. There is no doubt that I made it to where I am today because of you. Someone like you deserves no burdens or restrictions in life.”</p><p>Lauren paused for a moment and said, “I don’t even know how much that is.” Anthony replied, “It’s zero now.”&nbsp;</p><p>The older sister was overwhelmed by emotion and went to give her brother a big hug. Lauren faced multiple injuries during her basketball career but kept playing the sport. The Hoosier’s player wears the No.3 jersey to honor his sister.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtza2fqKapYrmmrctmpZ6sXay8s8DHZmlpamRiwKK4wKuwZpufo8GzrcKtZJyZopqys3nEmqmnoZ6cwHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html&text=Anthony%20Leal%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Salary%2c%20Contract%20%26amp%3b%20Career%20Earnings&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html&title=Anthony%20Leal%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Salary%2c%20Contract%20%26amp%3b%20Career%20Earnings" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html&title=Anthony%20Leal%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Salary%2c%20Contract%20%26amp%3b%20Career%20Earnings" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html&title=Anthony%20Leal%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Salary%2c%20Contract%20%26amp%3b%20Career%20Earnings" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-leal-net-worth-2024-salary-contract-career-earnings.html&description=Anthony%20Leal%20Net%20Worth%202024%3a%20Salary%2c%20Contract%20%26amp%3b%20Career%20Earnings" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./baylen-levine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Baylen Levine Biography, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zimbaxs-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Zimbaxs Girlfriend: Who is Zimbax Dating?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
