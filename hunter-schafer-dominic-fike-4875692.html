Hunter, 23, entered the public eye in 2017 for her protests against North Carolina’s Public Facilities Privacy And Security Act, which prevented transgender people who have not undergone gender reassignment surgery from using the bathrooms which affirm their gender. For her activism, the model, who is transgender, was featured in&nbsp;Teen Vogue, and she’s modeled for a variety of brands. Dominic, 26, rose to fame releasing his songs online, and he’s been a rising star in the music industry, collaborating with stars like Brockhampton’s&nbsp;<strong>Kevin Abstract&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Bieber&nbsp;</strong></a>on a number of tracks. He dropped his debut album&nbsp;What Could Possibly Go Wrong&nbsp;in 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While the couple are both stars from different fields, they are also both stars of the HBO series <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Euphoria</a>. Hunter plays Jules Vaughn, a trans student at the East Highland school. Dominic joined the cast in season two as Elliot, who interferes with Jules’ relationship with Rue (played&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Zendaya</strong></a>). Now that the couple have been dating for some time, find out more about the two&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;stars’ relationship.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hunter-Schafer-Dominic-Fike-relationship-timeline-embed1.jpg><h2>How did they meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>While Hunter Schafer and Dominic Fike have mostly kept their relationship private, it appears that the couple didn’t meet until the singer appeared on Euphoria.&nbsp;With the show’s second season premiering in January 2022, the couple met on-set for the show. While Hunter and Zendaya said that they were reluctant about the storylines that Elliot would bring to the show (and the “Rules” shippers), the model explained that they were both happy with what Dominic brought in a January 2022 interview with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. “As we saw more of what it brought into the story and the script, it became a more interesting and exciting prospect, and once Dom came on board, he made it a lot of fun,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Dominic revealed that he had an easy connection with Hunter as soon as they met during his first days shooting&nbsp;Euphoria,&nbsp;while he said some of his other co-stars were “very intimidating,” in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>GQ</a>&nbsp;profile. He explained that he was moved when he saw her film a crying scene and asked her to teach him how to cry on command. “I wanted to hug her. The tears started going, she said, ‘Okay, I’m ready.’ And then they did the scene,” he told&nbsp;GQ.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hunter-Schafer-Dominic-Fike-relationship-timeline-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>The&nbsp;Don’t Forget About Me&nbsp;singer explained that working on the show helped their relationship blossom, and before they knew it, they were falling in love. “In those moments, your relationship is accelerated,” he told GQ. “You’re so vulnerable with someone, immediately. Which usually takes a long time. Some people fall in love, like, f**king months after they meet, or years after. We developed an attraction—it sped it up so fast. We just really got to know each other so quickly.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>While they made their first public appearance together as a couple months later, the first of the pair’s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> red carpets</a> was actually when they appeared at a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> photocall for Euphoria&nbsp;</a>back in January, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.&nbsp;Along with shots of them with the cast and on their own, the two smiled for a photo together, but didn’t show any PDA.</p><h2>When did they become official?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>While the couple has mostly kept their relationship private, speculation that the two were an item began shortly after the second season (which included them smooching on-screen) premiered. They were seen holding hands on date nights in Hollywood in January, and Dominic even shared a photo of Hunter that he took backstage when she appeared on&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live in January, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>.&nbsp;Despite speculation, the couple seemed to confirmed their romance when Dominic posted a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> photo of them kissing</a> on his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story in February 2022. While the pair locked lips, the singer wrote “Happy birthday, happy birthday” in the pic.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Just days after the photo went live, Hunter was asked what her “dream festival lineup” would be in a video for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Magazine</a>. She listed Venezuelan musician&nbsp;<strong>Arca,&nbsp;</strong>late electronic pioneer&nbsp;<strong>Sophie&nbsp;</strong>“if she was still here,” rapper&nbsp;<strong>Quay Dash</strong>, and <strong>Tyler, The Creator</strong>.&nbsp;While she didn’t say anything more, she obviously included her boyfriend in her fantasy lineup. Later in the clip, the interviewer also asked “Why do fools fall in love?” Hunter responded with a laugh. “I’m a fool. S**t is dumb,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Dominic is clearly head-over-heels for Hunter. He revealed that he had gone to the Prada store in SoHo eight times in four days mostly to look at photos of his girlfriend in the ad displays, while she was out of town. He called the photos of her “the best part.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Nearly a month after going public on Instagram, the couple shared a few shots from a tropical vacation they took together on Dominic’s Instagram Story. He posted a shot of Hunter as well as one of them together by the water, via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Pop Crave.</a> Shortly after that, Hunter and Dominic made their red carpet debut at the Vanity Fair&nbsp;Oscars Party on March 27, 2022. Hunter stunned in a long gray gown, while the singer sported an all-black outfit, with glitter on his blazer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hunter-Schafer-Dominic-Fike-relationship-timeline-embed2.jpg><h2>Current relationship status</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>While the pair have mostly kept their relationship private, the pair seems to still be going strong, months after first making their romance public.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>They have been spotted out on a few occasions, and they’ve shown love to each other on<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> social media</a> on occasion. Despite some rumors that the pair had split up (via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seventeen</a>), fans spotted the pair holding hands while walking around at the Outside Lands music fest back in August and shared the video on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Twitter</a>. When summer 2022 came to an end, Hunter included a shot of her and Dominic cozying up together in a photo dump on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. She also commented a heart on one of Dominic’s September <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posts</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8eupa2domLApLTAn5yrZZSkuqq6yJxkn6Gbmnp1hJZubXJqXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html&text=Official%20Relationship%20Timeline%2c%20Details%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html&title=Official%20Relationship%20Timeline%2c%20Details%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html&title=Official%20Relationship%20Timeline%2c%20Details%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html&title=Official%20Relationship%20Timeline%2c%20Details%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhunter-schafer-dominic-fike-4875692.html&description=Official%20Relationship%20Timeline%2c%20Details%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-happened-to-candy-husband-pat-montgomery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Happened to Candy Husband Pat Montgomery?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nicole-nafziger-really-dumped-by-azan-when-she-ran-out-of-cash.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicole Nafziger: DUMPED by Azan When She Ran Out of Cash?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
