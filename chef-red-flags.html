It's a nice thing to do! But I don't think people who haven't worked in restaurants understand just how gross is can get behind the scenes of even the fanciest joints. Someone asked the chefs of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> to share the red flags everyone should look out for when they go out to eat. Some of these are common sense; others, I've never even thought of before.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"Grade pending"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: NYC Grade Fixers</a></figure><p>You know how restaurants in some states have that big letter grade from the health inspector hanging up in their doorway. Well, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ImSuperSick</a> explains, "Grade Pending" doesn't mean they are waiting for a grade. "It means that they failed and are given a grace period to fix their wrongs." Better avoid those places.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sick waitstaff</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If you can tell that the waitstaff is under the weather, maybe don't eat there, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thick_andy</a> says. If the servers are sick, there's a good chance you're going to get sick, too.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dirty dining room</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BringMeTwo</a> isn't a chef, but they used to work for a pest control service, and it was always the restaurants with dirty or gross dining rooms where they found trouble. If the front-facing area of the restaurant is nasty, imagine what's going on in the back. Ick.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Grabbing glasses</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This bad habit bothers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arseniy1234555</a> and my mom alike. When waitstaff grab clean glasses at the top, a.k.a. the area that you'll be putting your mouth to, that's a big red flag. No one wants to taste someone else's fingers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Salt shakers</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If the salt shakers are clogged or the tops are dirty, there's a good chance they haven't been cleaned in a very long time. And if they don't clean the salt shakers, imagine what else they don't clean. Thanks for this tip, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">faployst</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Flour everywhere</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ihatetheplaceilive</a> begs anyone with a serious gluten intolerance or wheat allergy not to eat at a scratch Italian restaurant. Even though these places might offer gluten-free options, there's flour everywhere, and there's simply nothing they can do about it.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Soda machines</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>This is an important one. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StumbleKitty</a> is a former health inspector who says if you're at a place with a self-serve soda machine, take a napkin to the inside of the nozzle for whichever soda is clear (Sprite/7-Up, etc.). If it comes out pink or orange, that's slime mold. Ew. If it's brown, it might be cola, but that still means that the nozzles aren't being cleaned properly.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Overworked waitstaff</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If the staff appears overworked, overwhelmed, or pissed off, maybe come back another time. If they're stretched thin, there's a lot of proper policy that could be flying out the window. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiendlymcfiend</a> knows what they're talking about.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dirty menus</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>It's so gross when you're handed a menu and there's gross, caked on food crusted to the edge. If a restaurant can't be bothered to clean their own menus, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nissir</a> says, chances are there's a lot more that isn't getting the attention it deserves.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Two different restaurants</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>Generally, it's a good rule of thumb to avoid places that seem like they could be two (or more) different restaurants. Does a place serve pizza and sushi? Maybe you should skip it, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rukasu83</a>. Of course, there are exceptions to this rule (sushi and burger joints are actually a thing), but make sure you do your research before you head to one of these places.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Coffee machines</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If you're at a place with a visible coffee machine, "take a look at the steamer," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fernanzgz</a>. "If it's covered in white, that means they don't clean after frothing the milk." And it's very important to clean up old milk.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Dry spots</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>I feel like at one point or another, we've all been to a restaurant where we've been handed a sad plate of food with dry spots in the corners. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoonedkittens</a>, this means it has been left out for a long time, either in the cooked or raw state.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oyster origin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MaterialImportance</a> implores us to please ask where the oysters and all seafood comes from before you order it at a restaurant. "If they don't know, you don't want them," they write.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Weird smell</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Renewed_artist</a> warns us that if there's a "funky smell that's even slightly (or stronger) urine-like," that probably means the restaurant has a rodent problem. And that's about as unsanitary as it gets.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Too many unfed tables</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>One chef, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">jeraco73</a>, tells us that if the restaurant is busy but there are a lot of tables that don't have their food yet, "this usually means the kitchen is going down in flames." You don't want whatever cut-corners meal they're going to serve you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fishy smell</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bellabane</a> tells us, "If you actually smell fish at a sushi restaurant, it's in your and your insides' best interest to hightail it out of there." Fresh, sushi-grade fish shouldn't really have a fishy smell.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fried chicken no-no</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SlayinDaWabbits</a> is a pest control professional who warns us that "95 percent of quick-serve fried chicken places are vomit-inducing. Particularly one based with an old guy as its mascot." Hm. That's reasoning enough for me to skip fried chicken places pretty much forever.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">"No substitutions"</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>Whenever I see "no substitutions" on a menu, I think the restaurant is just being stuck up and pretentious about its own food, but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edymnion</a>, it sometimes means you're "getting frozen meals run through the microwave." I've never thought about that before, but it makes sense.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cross-contamination</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If you follow a very strict diet that you want to adhere to while you're eating out, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sitbuttadopo</a>, don't eat out at most regular restaurants that offer only a few options that are vegan, gluten-free, etc. Cross-contamination happens way more often than we think. If you're militant about your vegan diet, for example, go to a completely vegan restaurant, not a restaurant with one or two vegan items.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hidden health score</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock Photo</span></figure><p>If restaurants have a health score to be proud of, they will display it front and center. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gorytory</a> tells us that if you can't readily see a restaurant's health inspection grade, there's probably a reason for that.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWmsoyrnJ1llqGuqL8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchef-red-flags.html&text=Chefs%20Share%20the%20Red%20Flags%20People%20Should%20Notice%20When%20Dining%20Out&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchef-red-flags.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchef-red-flags.html&title=Chefs%20Share%20the%20Red%20Flags%20People%20Should%20Notice%20When%20Dining%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchef-red-flags.html&title=Chefs%20Share%20the%20Red%20Flags%20People%20Should%20Notice%20When%20Dining%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchef-red-flags.html&title=Chefs%20Share%20the%20Red%20Flags%20People%20Should%20Notice%20When%20Dining%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchef-red-flags.html&description=Chefs%20Share%20the%20Red%20Flags%20People%20Should%20Notice%20When%20Dining%20Out" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jordan-calloway-19901018-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordan Calloway (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bob-reese.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bob Reese">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
