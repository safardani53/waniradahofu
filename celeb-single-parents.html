That's entirely true. Anyone who's got a kid can tell you just how crazy difficult it is to rear a kid right. It takes from a multitude of different influences and resources, from close friends and family members to neighbors, aunts, uncles, cousins, teachers, you name it.</p><p>Being a single parent is a whole other ball game too, even if you're a rich and famous celebrity.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So in honor of National Single Parent Day, here are some celebs who are doing the parenting thing alone.</h2><p>Well, for the most part. Celebrities tend to have higher net worths, so it's hard to imagine that they aren't able to get some additional help, but the COVID-19 pandemic has become a "parenting equalizer" of sorts.&nbsp;</p><p>With lockdown orders in effect and self-quarantining protocols implemented, not to mention kids being forced into home-schooling scenarios, parents from all walks of life have similar experiences rearing their kids now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sandra Bullock</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Prior to splitting from husband Jesse James, Sandra was taking care of three stepchildren with the Monster Garage star.

She's had three children from three different husbands.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Orlando Bloom</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The man also known as Legolas divorced Australian model Miranda Kerr in 2013, and he's constantly spotted spending time with his son, Flynn, bringing him to events and looking every part the happy and involved dad.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Padma Lakshmi</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Top Chef host Padma Lakshmi was known as being the face of the high-end culinary world (at least when it came to TV competitions) and being the ex of controversial writer Salman Rushdie. However, the father of her surprise baby was actually venture capitalist Adam Dell. Padma reportedly called the pregnancy a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"medical miracle"</a> given the fact that she's been diagnosed with endometriosis.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ricky Martin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The "Vente Pa' Ca" singer was able to have two children thanks to surrogacy, and in 2008, he welcomed both Matteo and Valentino into the world. Recently, in December 2018 he had a daughter, Lucia, through surrogacy as well. Since 2017, he's been romantically linked to Jwan Yosef.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michelle Williams</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Michelle Williams became a single parent after the tragic death of actor Heath Ledger, father of their child Matilda.

Richards has full-time mom duties with the two little kiddos and apparently takes them everywhere with her. A quick internet search and you'll find tons of candid photos of them having a blast together.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Antonio Banderas</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The Laundromat star separated from Melanie Griffith in 2014 and is known to be a very hands-on dad with his biological daughter Stella del Carmen as well as Griffith's children from a previous relationship, Alexander and Dakota.</p><p>Banderas <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once said in an interview</a> that there's a big difficulty associated with being a parent and working in entertainment, due to not being able to spend enough time with one's children.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Liv Tyler</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Liv Tyler broke up with ex-husband Royston Langdon in 2009 and the two of them had a baby boy together by the name of Milo, who was born in December of 2004. She told People that her son calls her "precious" which is probably a lot cuter coming from him than it was her co-star Andy Serkis when he was playing Gollum.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Louis Tomlinson</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The One Direction band member had his baby son, Freddie, with Briana Jungwirth, a stylist.

She has been vocal about where prospective new partners stand in her life and what it's like dating as a single mom: "Some men are daunted by it, some are really attracted. I had someone ask, ‘Does this mean we can’t go out anytime we want?’ And I said, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what it means. It means you come fourth, ’cause it’s my kids, my job, my family.’ I don’t ever want to come first to anyone. It’s too much pressure," she said in an interview with More, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per OK Magazine</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Idris Elba</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Idris Elba's first child, Isan, was born in 2002 with his first wife Kim Norgaard, and she is no stranger to red carpet events. She was named the 2019 Golden Globes Ambassador and she advocates for mental health initiatives for black teens.
