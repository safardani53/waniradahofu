But, most hardcore F1 fans will probably want to get behind the wheel of a professional supercar themselves.</p><p>The best F1 experience days are on many people’s bucket lists, but like <a href=#>rally driving</a>, <a href=#>flying</a>, and <a href=#>hot air balloon experiences</a>, these once in a lifetime opportunities are pretty expensive to make a reality.</p><p>Don't worry though, there are plenty of affordable options that will allow you to take to the track in a genuine F1 car without breaking the bank.</p><p>For an experience similar to driving an F1 car, it's worth trying a simulator. While not quite the real thing, remember that seasoned F1 drivers use simulators to familiarise themselves with certain tracks as well as brushing up on racing lines and braking points.</p><p>Simulator experiences are cheap too, often coming in at under £50 for a decent amount of 'track' time.</p><p>If you fancy some open-wheel action but can't quite stretch to the £1,000+ that's often required for full-on F1 experiences, there are lots of affordable experiences to book.</p><p>And, there are plenty of F1000 driving days out there, which is essentially a miniature F1 car. They have significantly less power and pace than the real thing, but for very little money you can find yourself behind the wheel of a single-seat race car at one of the UK's finest tracks.</p><p>You could also try F4, which are track-prepared race cars that can hit up to 165mph. These single-seaters are seriously quick and will test the mettle of even the most hardened motorsport fans.</p><p>Then there are, of course, the actual F1 experiences. If your budget allows you, can pay to jump into one of your own for the day. Expect plenty of professional tuition, as well as sighting laps and warm-ups in slower open-wheel machines before you drive the real thing.</p><p>Any of these options make a great present for racing fanatics. So whatever it is you're looking for and whatever your budget, these are the best F1 driving experiences available.</p><h2>Best F1 driving experiences at a glance</h2><h2>Virgin Simulator Race Experience</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/f1-grand-prix-simulator-19144428.jpeg><ul><li><strong>Virgin Simulator Race Experience, £45 from Virgin - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>The cheapest way to feel as though you’re driving an F1 car is a simulator.

Plus, you get at least seven races — so there are plenty of chances to show off your skills.</p><p>There are no weight or age limits, so this experience is open to all. However, you do have to be 4ft 5 and over, and under 16s need to be accompanied by an adult.</p><p><strong>Location: </strong>Halifax and Chandler's Ford, Hampshire; <strong>Time in car:&nbsp;</strong>1 hour; <strong>Type of car:&nbsp;</strong>Simulator; <strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>£45</p><h2>Silverstone Supercar Experience</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Aston-Martin-Car-Taxonomy_20_281_29.png><ul><li><strong>Silverstone Supercar Experience, from £449 at Silverstone - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Silverstone is one of the world's most famous driving tracks, and for £449, it's yours to race on for the day.</p><p>Over the course of 2.5 hours, you'll race three exhilarating supercars: the McLaren 620R, Ferrari F430 Coupe and the Aston Martin Vantage.

As you'll know, the owner of the drinks company — Dietrich Mateschitz — bought the remnants of Jaguar racing from Ford back in 2005 and founded an F1 team after formerly sponsoring a number of drivers.</p><p>You might not be able to drive the cars, but you can look and touch as much as you like.</p><p>You can also visit the new MK-7 facility, where you'll find a number of Red Bull Racing's best cars.&nbsp;And at the end of the day, you'll take home a special gift to remind you of the experience.</p><p><strong>Location: </strong>Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire; <strong>Time in car: </strong>N/A; <strong>Type of car: </strong>N/A; <strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>£600</p><h2>Goodwood Track Day</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/dsc_6147.png><ul><li><strong>Goodwood Track Day, from £130 from Goodwood.com - <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">buy here</a></strong></li></ul><p>Follow in the steps of racing legends Jim Clark and Sir Jackie Stewart and spend the day racing at Goodwood. You can choose to book a half day for £130 to £220 (depending on the noise limit day), or a full day for £250 to £425.</p><p>This one is less about the car you're driving and more about the track since you'll be driving your own car throughout the whole day.</p><p>If you book a half-day experience, you'll get at least three 15-minute driving sessions. And if you book a full day, you'll get double the amount.</p><p>On both experience days, you'll receive a full briefing with the Chief Driving Instructor, a buffet lunch, and barista-style tea and coffee throughout the day. The price covers this for one person, but can also have guests join you for lunch for an extra £21 per person.</p><p><strong>Location: </strong>Goodwood, West Sussex; <strong>Time in car: </strong>Half day = 3 x 15 minute driving sessions, full day = 6 x 15 minute driving sessions; <strong>Type of car: </strong>Your own; <strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>£130</p><h2>How much do F1 experiences cost?</h2><p>The cost of an F1 experience varies depending on a number of factors. If you want to spend a whole day driving the fastest cars on the most famous tracks, you're going to be spending upwards of £1,000.&nbsp; However, if you're happy to book a shorter session, drive a car that isn't as fast, or spend half of your time in the passenger seat, you'll be able to save money. The cheapest way to do it is by booking a simulation experience.</p><h2>Are F1 driving experiences safe?</h2><p>There are risks associated with driving at super speed, but all of these driving experiences start with a safety briefing. You'll never be put in a dangerous situation, you'll always have the necessary safety equipment, and you'll be surrounded by experts who give you continuous coaching.</p><h2>Are F1 experiences worth it?</h2><p>If you read the reviews of each and every one of these experiences, you'll see that nearly all of the customers would say the experiences are worth it. To give yourself the best chance of being happy with the experience, read the itineraries thoroughly to ensure it meets your expectations.</p><h2>Where to buy Formula 1 driving experience days</h2><p>You can buy a Formula 1 driving experience day at a range of experience gifting sites and through the sites of the tracks themselves, for example:</p><h2>Do I need a driving licence for an F1 experience day?</h2><p>For every F1 experience day that involves driving an actual car, you'll need a full driving licence. If you don't have a driving license, you can book an F1 simulator race experience or museum experience instead.</p><h2>How many Gs do F1 drivers experience?</h2><p>The average G-force in Formula 1 is about 6-7G. They'll typically experience 5G while braking, 2G while accelerating, 0,6G when bouncing, and 6G while cornering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZm9uYm59c3yOm5ysrF2bfm6w0aKtoqaXYrK5vMSroJ6mk5p6pa3YrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html&text=9%20best%20F1%20driving%20experience%20UK%202023%20%7c%20The%20Sun%20UK&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html&title=9%20best%20F1%20driving%20experience%20UK%202023%20%7c%20The%20Sun%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html&title=9%20best%20F1%20driving%20experience%20UK%202023%20%7c%20The%20Sun%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html&title=9%20best%20F1%20driving%20experience%20UK%202023%20%7c%20The%20Sun%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-f1-driving-experience-days.html&description=9%20best%20F1%20driving%20experience%20UK%202023%20%7c%20The%20Sun%20UK" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bradley-nowell-19680222-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bradley Nowell (Reggae Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./does-american-rapper-anderson-paak-have-wife-know-about-his-girlfriends-rumor-affairs.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is American Rapper Anderson Paak Married To?
