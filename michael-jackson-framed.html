But then there are some reports from individuals spouting some seemingly insane-at-first theories that end up being true. And many people think that may be the case with the theory that <a href=#>Michael Jackson</a> was framed for child abuse as a cover up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Michael Jackson really framed? And if so, why?</h2><p>According to <a href=#>Corey Feldman</a>, Michael Jackson was framed as a way to cover up more child abuse — like, a ring of pedophiles in Hollywood who regularly engage in abusing children. According to Crime Online, the child actor alleges that the King of Pop was being framed for molesting kids as a means of covering up a dangerous gang of powerful men in show business who do the same.</p><p>In a November 2017 appearance on <a href=#>Dr. Oz</a>' show, Corey Feldman accused actor Jon Grissom of exploiting him for 16 years. In a separate interview with <a href=#>Megyn Kelly</a>, Feldman also named a talent manager by the name of Marty Weiss as being one of his abusers. Weiss was actually sentenced to prison on child molestation charges but only served six months. When he was released, he was put on a sex offender list.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Jon Grissom actually still has an active <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MySpace page</a> (yes, MySpace) that includes shirtless photos of him along with pictures of him posing with Feldman.</p><p>Feldman states that the allegations made against Michael Jackson were a plot construed by abusers who didn't want their "ring" exposed, Feldman told Dr. Oz.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"They were trying to frame Michael Jackson and bury the Corey Feldman story. I've spent my entire life fighting this battle. No one was listening then. No one is listening now. [The] LAPD is still not investigating it."</p><p>Feldman went on to say that while he and Jackson's friendship never veered into inappropriate territory, he doesn't doubt that there may be some merit to the accusations levied against the singer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I'm here to say I hope and I pray that these things never happened, and if they never happened, then there's some real sickness with a lot of people. But if they did happen, then there's a lot of sickness with one person. And that person needs to be punished," Feldman said in a sit-down with Martin Bashir.</p><p>The one incident he did remember having with Michael was regarding a book Michael had laid out on his coffee table.</p><p>"We went to his apartment, and I noticed a book that he had out on his coffee table. The book contained pictures of grown men and women naked. And the book was focused on venereal diseases and the genitalia. I was kind of grossed out by it. I didn't think of it as a big deal. And for all these years, I probably never thought twice about it. But in light of recent evidence, I have to say that if my son was 14 years old, 13 years old and went to a man's apartment that was 35, and I knew that they were sitting down together talking about this, I would probably beat his a--."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One of the biggest pieces of evidence from the "Was Michael Jackson framed?" theory are the missing 1993 interview tapes.</h2><p>The Santa Barbara Police Department claims that they had lost tapes of Feldman's interview regarding Michael Jackson's investigation in the early '90s. A few days before Feldman's interview, authorities stated that the tapes had been found and sent to the LAPD for further review. Harvey Levin of TMZ — who is also an executive producer of Celebrity Justice — actually found the tapes and handed them over to police.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"Parents should be shaking. I don't have my kids in this industry, what does that tell you? Vindication will come when my best friend [Corey Haim]'s perpetrators are behind bars, my perpetrators are behind bars."</p><p>After Feldman's movie, My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys was released, there was a lot of pushback to the accusations levied in the film. A lot of the pushback came from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haim's own mother and sister</a> who categorically reject many of the claims made in the movie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2aikZi4tLvNZp2rmZ2asQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html&text=Was%20Michael%20Jackson%20Framed%3f%20Tons%20of%20People%20Are%20Totally%20Convinced%20He%20Was&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html&title=Was%20Michael%20Jackson%20Framed%3f%20Tons%20of%20People%20Are%20Totally%20Convinced%20He%20Was" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html&title=Was%20Michael%20Jackson%20Framed%3f%20Tons%20of%20People%20Are%20Totally%20Convinced%20He%20Was" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html&title=Was%20Michael%20Jackson%20Framed%3f%20Tons%20of%20People%20Are%20Totally%20Convinced%20He%20Was" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-jackson-framed.html&description=Was%20Michael%20Jackson%20Framed%3f%20Tons%20of%20People%20Are%20Totally%20Convinced%20He%20Was" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-hope-davis-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Hope Davis Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rio-ferdinand-appalling-food.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rio Ferdinands Italian restaurant blasted by customers over appalling food  The Sun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
