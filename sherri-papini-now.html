Maybe you're exhausted and need a vacation, but inexplicably can't tell family and friends about it.

Doesn't it always come down to money?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sherri Papini</a> lied about being kidnapped, but her story didn't end once she "returned" to her home in Redding, Calif. after being gone for three weeks.

The plea deal allowed Sherri to waive her right to a jury trial, and she was ordered to pay $308,000 in restitution to the California Victim Compensation Board, the Shasta County Sheriff's office, the FBI, and the Social Security Administration.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KRON4</a>, Sherri began serving her 18-month sentence in "Federal Correctional Institution Victorville, a medium security federal prison in San Bernardino County."</p><p>Now a new Oxygen special will reveal more alarming details about Sherri's deceit. In Sherri Papini: Lies, Lies and More Lies we're going to get exactly that.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Per the synopsis and the trailer exclusively shared with Distractify, "the special takes viewers on an up-close-and-personal journey through all of Papini’s lies, building heavily upon just-released investigative footage, including hours of previously unseen law enforcement interviews with Papini herself. It also features interviews with investigators, journalists, and community members who were all at some point taken in by Papini’s untruths."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Sherri Papini?</h2><p>On Nov. 2, 2016, Sherri went out for a jog in Redding, Calif. where she lived with her husband Keith Papini and their two children. When Keith arrived home from work later that day, he found it odd that neither Sherri nor the children were home. She should have picked them up from daycare by that point.</p><p>After calling the daycare facility and discovering that his children were still there, Keith began to worry. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inquisitr</a>, he used the "Find My iPhone" app to determine that Sherri's phone had been dropped somewhere along her usual jogging route. Her earbuds as well as several strands of her hair were with the phone. Other than that, authorities had nothing to go on until Sherri miraculously reappeared, 150 miles away from where she was allegedly taken.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">San Francisco Chronicle</a> noted that Sherri was spotted by a truck driver who was headed north on I-5. "She was bound with restraints and was found with a brand on her left shoulder," reported the SF Chronicle. Keith released a statement to the media about Sherri's condition which, at the time, investigators weren't aware of. They were still actively looking for her kidnappers, and Keith releasing information like that to the press was potentially compromising to their case.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Los Angeles Times picked up the statement, which detailed her physical status at the time she was found. "My first sight was my wife in a hospital bed, her face covered in bruises ranging from yellow to black because of repeated beatings, the bridge of her nose broken," Keith said. Evidently, she had also been branded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What did Sherri Papini claim happened to her?</h2><p>Once she was physically able to, Sherri told authorities that "two Latina women held her at gunpoint and kept her in a small closet during three weeks of captivity," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The LA Times</a>. What Sherri was actually doing was hiding out in her ex-boyfriend's home in Orange County. She lied and told her ex that Keith was abusing her, and she needed to get away for a while. So, the ex drove 150 miles to Northern California to pick her up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The injuries she sustained were self-inflicted, which included being branded. While Sherri was missing, a GoFundMe account was set up in her name which would eventually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">raise $49,000</a>. This money was used for personal reasons. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> found that on Dec. 6, 2016, Keith "wrote a $31,818.13 check to himself from the GoFundMe account." He maintains he knew nothing about the hoax. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> added that Sherri spent $3,053 of the GoFundMe money to pay off a credit card.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now it appears Sherri will owe so much more than that. On Sept. 20, 2022, she was sentenced to 18 months in prison. Per NPR, prosecutors wanted her to serve eight months, but Senior U.S. District Judge William Shubb chose to sentence her to 18 months in order to deter others from following in her footsteps. "The nation is watching," he said. "They need to be sent the right message... We have to make sure crime doesn't pay."</p><p>Sherri had to turn herself into a federal prison official no later than Nov. 8, 2022. Until she turned herself in, she stayed with Keith's sister, with whom she has been staying since she and Keith separated. Keith filed for divorce from Sherri on April 20, 2022, and also sought custody of their children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How did authorities figure out Sherri Papini was lying?</h2><p>Shasta County Sheriff Sergeant Kyle Wallace and Captain Brian Jackson both knew something wasn't quite right. They worked the case from day one and always found that the entire situation was a bit too dramatic. Also, Sherri didn't really cooperate with authorities after she reappeared.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Keith was determined to find Sherri's abductors, Sherri wasn't very forthcoming with any information. "Papini made up a story about her abductions being connected with law enforcement. She would often withhold from investigators or refuse to provide certain details," investigators said during a Dateline special back in April 2022.</p><p>In 2020, her clothing was examined and police found no DNA evidence that matched up with Sherri's claim that two Hispanic women took her. What they did find was the DNA of an unknown male, which turned out to be her ex-boyfriend's. Once they spoke to him, he revealed that Sherri had been with him and, while there, "asked him to hit her — he would not, but he agreed to hold a hockey stick for her to run into and to pelt her with hockey pucks. He also branded her when she asked him to."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watching evening news on Sherri Papini the woman who faked her 2016 kidnapping facing “jail time and a massive fine.” After the time and effort she cost officials she needs to be facing a fine and massive jail time.

Let's let <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> take it away:</p><p>"Papini's staged kidnapping cost the California Victim's Compensation Board over $30,000 in therapy visits and an ambulance trip and cost the United States Social Security Administration more than $127,000, which she will be required to pay back. Papini will also have to pay $148,866 to the Shasta County Sheriff's Office, the law enforcement agency that investigated the staged kidnapping, and $2,558 to the FBI."</p><p>While Sherri's scam ended up costing her so much more than she gained, unfortunately it looks like she won't have to give any of the GoFundMe money back.</p><p>The special premieres on Oxygen on Saturday, December 17 at 9pm ET/PT.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWmvtGiZKmZoJ67qnnNqK4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsherri-papini-now.html&text=Where%20Is%20Sherri%20Papini%20Now%3f%20Details%20on%20%26quot%3bAbducted%26quot%3b%20Mother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsherri-papini-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsherri-papini-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Sherri%20Papini%20Now%3f%20Details%20on%20%26quot%3bAbducted%26quot%3b%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsherri-papini-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Sherri%20Papini%20Now%3f%20Details%20on%20%26quot%3bAbducted%26quot%3b%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsherri-papini-now.html&title=Where%20Is%20Sherri%20Papini%20Now%3f%20Details%20on%20%26quot%3bAbducted%26quot%3b%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsherri-papini-now.html&description=Where%20Is%20Sherri%20Papini%20Now%3f%20Details%20on%20%26quot%3bAbducted%26quot%3b%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-brady-quinn-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Brady Quinn Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./prince-william-issues-threat-ill-sue-if-you-report-my-affair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I'll SUE YOU ALL if You Report on My Affair!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
