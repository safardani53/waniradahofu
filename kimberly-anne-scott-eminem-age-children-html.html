Kim and her twin sister had run from home at the time.</p><h2>Kim And&nbsp;Eminem Married Twice</h2><p>After knowing each other from an early age,&nbsp;Kimberly Anne Scott and Eminem blossomed their friendship into a relationship. The relationship, eventually, yielded&nbsp;results, as they welcomed their first biological child, a daughter named&nbsp;Hailey Jade, on December 25, 1995.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-4 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>To strengthen their relationship, the teenage lovers got hitched in the year 1999 — about four years after becoming parents together.&nbsp;However, the marital relationship did not go well as they divorced within two years of marriage, in 2001.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>One of the&nbsp;reasons for their separation was the 2000s incident when&nbsp;Eminem reportedly found Kimberly kissing rapper John Guerra in the parking lot. That also led him to whip John with a 9mm pistol, followed by his getting arrested.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>But the former couple again reconsidered each other — the two got married for the second time in January 2006. But the reunion did not last long either, as they filed for&nbsp;divorce just three months later.</p><p>In her defense, Kim sat with ABC News and alleged that their relationship was no longer the same after Eminem got famous.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>She also noted that both of them cheated in their relationship but she never went to the media to talk about them, unlike her former partner.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim revealed that Eminem left her and their children on 25 February 2006 after she had an argument with his brother&nbsp;and later send his attorney a month after with divorce papers.&nbsp;</p><h2>Kim's Children Are&nbsp;Raised by Eminem</h2><p>Although Eminem has only one biological daughter,&nbsp;Hailey Jade, with&nbsp;Kim Scott, he did raise&nbsp;two other daughters:&nbsp;Whitney Scott Mathers (Stevie Lane Mathers), and&nbsp;Alaina Marie Mathers (Kim's niece they adopted, the biological daughter of her sister <a href=# rel="follow noopener">who died of heroin overdose</a> in 2016).</p><p>Both the other two daughters are connected to Kim.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kim Scott (second from left) with her children: Alaina Marie Mathers (first left),&nbsp;Hailey Jade (first right),&nbsp;Whitney Scott Mathers (second from right), and&nbsp;Parker Scott (in front) (Source: Pinterest</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>Among the other two, Alaina Marie Mathers is Kim's twin sister Dawn's biological daughter. Alaina<a href=# rel=follow>,</a>&nbsp;who was born on 3 May 1993, to Dawn Scott, was <a href=# rel=follow>adopted by Eminem and Kim</a>.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>&nbsp;The former couple did so to&nbsp;ensure that Alaina did not succumb to her mother's fate, as her mother, Dawn, had trouble with drugs and lived a troubled lifestyle.</p><p>Speaking about&nbsp;Whitney Scott Mathers,&nbsp;Kim gave birth to her in 2002 with her ex-partner&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Eric Hatter</a>, a tattoo artist.</p><p>She was in a brief relationship with Hatter after her first divorce from&nbsp;Eminem in 2001. They separated after the birth of&nbsp;Whitney.&nbsp;Eminem adopted&nbsp;Whitney and raised her along with his other two daughters.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>Presently, as of May&nbsp;2023, all three girls are grown up — Hailey Jade is 27&nbsp;years old and a graduate&nbsp;of&nbsp;Michigan State University.</p><p>Whitney Scott Mathers is 21 years old and&nbsp;proudly bi. &nbsp;Alaina Marie Mathers is 30 years old and often stays away from the limelight.</p><h2>Parker Scott</h2><p>Parker Scott is the youngest of all the children.</p><p>His exact birthdate is yet unknown, however, both Kim and Marshall have confirmed that Eminem is not his&nbsp;father.</p><p>Unsubstantiated rumors point to Parker's dad's name being&nbsp;Mick Parker. However, there is no evidence to back this claim other than internet hearsay.</p><p>Despite Eminem being the biological father of only 1 of the 4 children, he has never let that stop him from embracing all his children as his own and showering them with love, admiration, and care.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_11"></span><h2>Kim Was Abused by Step Father at a Young Age</h2><p>Kimberly Anne Scott was born on&nbsp;January 9, 1975,&nbsp;in Warren, Michigan, USA. She was born as a twin alongside her sister Dawn Scott.</p><p>The twin sisters were born to&nbsp;mother&nbsp;Kathleen Sluck and&nbsp;father Casimer Sluck; however, they were&nbsp;made to know very little about their father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports People</a>.</p><p>Kim's mother, later, married another man, and thus, the twin sisters were raised by their mother and stepfather.</p><p>But the twins had to experience a tough childhood, courtesy of their alcoholic stepfather who often abused them. Because of that, they&nbsp;ran away from home in 1988 and&nbsp;settled at a youth shelter outside of Detroit.</p><h2>Eminem Took Kim His Home, Shortly After They Met</h2><p>Kimberly Anne Scott and her now ex-husband&nbsp;Eminem met&nbsp;for the first time at a house party. At that time, she was on a run from her abusive father and was only 13 years old, while the legendary rapper was 15.</p><p></p><p><strong>Kimberly Anne Scott and her ex-husband&nbsp;Eminem (Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TheSun</a>)</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_12"></span><p>In the book,&nbsp;How Eminem Got Started: Lessons from a Legend (How It All Got Started),&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Ramses M,&nbsp;the 48&nbsp;years old rapper recalled the very first time he met Kim.</p><p>He remembered, "I’m standing on top of their coffee table with my shirt off, with a Kangol on, mocking the words to LL Cool J’s ‘I’m Bad.’ And I turn around and she’s at the door smoking."</p><p>In a short period of knowing each other,&nbsp;Eminem&nbsp;bought Kim to his house and introduced her to his mother, Debbie Nelson.</p><p>"He introduced her as Kim Scott and said she needed a place to stay. I was happy to help out. Kim said she was 15 and I had no reason to doubt that. In truth, she was so cute and busty that she could have passed at 17, " Eminem's mother Nelson stated&nbsp;in her 2008 memoir&nbsp;My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem.</p><h2>Kimberly Ann Scott has Decent Net Worth despite Jailtime & Drug Trouble</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>,&nbsp;Kim Scott has a total net worth of&nbsp;$2 million.</p><p>Although the source of her&nbsp;income is unknown,&nbsp;it can be assumed that her ex-husband&nbsp;Eminem has contributed to her net worth. The legendary rapper's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">net worth</a> marks over&nbsp;$230 million.</p><p>In 2001, Kim and Emionem agreed that she would receive&nbsp;$475,000 to search for a new home as the rapper would keep their $450,000 Michigan home as part of their <a href=# rel="follow noopener">divorce settlement</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>They also accepted to have mutual child custody.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span><p>In November of the same month, the Macomb County&nbsp;court ordered him to pay $52,000 annually to Kim in child support.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, in the summer of 2001, she was charged with drug possession after police found her with&nbsp;a “white powdery substance" in the back of a patrol car.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident also led to Kim getting less child support amount than claimed because the judge also accounted that she may not be able to take full responsibility for their children.</p><p>Later in 2003, she was arrested again for possession of two bags of cocaine and unsafe driving.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident resulted in Kim paying a hefty fine. At the time, she had already been put on probation in her 2001's drug possession verdict.&nbsp;</p><p>However, she violated the probation and was kept a month in jail.</p><p>Later in their 2006's divorce (married in January, filed in December), they also agreed to a property settlement deal, which now remains unrevealed.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_14"></span><p>At the time, Kim's lawyer said to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">People</a> that Kim was looking forward to moving on in her life.&nbsp;</p><p>“She is a very articulate, very smart woman. She is going back to college to study design. She just wants to be a mom and go back to college. That’s what she wants to do right now,” she said.</p><p>She also revealed that the pair's relationship was not over. She shared,</p><p>There was a lot of sadness about why this didn’t work out. They’ve been together for 17 years. They’re life-long friends, lovers, have been husband and wife, they’re raising children together… It’s not the end and it’s not over between them.</p><p>And in 2013, Kim's mother<a href=# rel="follow noopener">&nbsp;Kathy Sluck (died 2021) </a>revealed that her former son-in-law was building a house for the mother of his children (Kim).&nbsp;</p><p>She said that the house was located just five miles from his house.</p><p>Talking to <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Dailymail</a>, she also claimed that the relationship between them was better and claimed that they might get back together soon.</p><p>As per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a>, Eminem has reportedly, or in some cases rumoredly, dated&nbsp;the likes of Kaya Jones, Britney Spears (2002), Brittany Murphy (2002), Mariah Carey, Karrine Steffans (2003, rumor), Joy McAvoy (2000's) and&nbsp;Tara Reid (mentioned in album Kamikaze).</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span><h2>Quick Facts About&nbsp;Kim Scott</h2><ul><li>In 2009,&nbsp;Kim Scott authored a children's book&nbsp;titled Mommy!
