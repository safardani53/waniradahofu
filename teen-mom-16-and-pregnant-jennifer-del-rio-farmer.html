I just said it out of anger.</p><p>"He's had a rocky life ever since the show, although the twins talk to him every few months - maybe once or twice a year."</p><p>Jenn won the nasty custody battle against Josh back in 2012, and she reflected: "I wanted full custody because I wanted to know my children were safe with me, not because I wanted him out of the picture."</p><p>The <a href=#>Teen Mom</a> said she has warned her ex: "The door is always open to having a relationship [with the twins], but if you mess that up, that's on you."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Now, Jenn is married to Luis and they share a son, Sebastian, nine, and a daughter, Annabella, five.</p><p>Jenn shares her twin boys Joshua and Noah, 12, with her ex Josh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/i-reality-star-16-pregnant-806622730.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/i-reality-star-16-pregnant-806623412.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/like-wild-fire-teen-mom-753981678.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZ2qDdX6SaKuenZ5iurC5jGptZpmemXqxvsSgpZqmpGK3prrNop2eql2Zsq150aKmZp6Rp7qmvo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html&text=I%20was%20a%20reality%20star%20on%2016%20%26amp%3b%20Pregnant%20but%20now%20I%27m%20a%20goat%20milk%20farmer-%20and%20I%20don%27t%20regret%20leaving%20the&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html&title=I%20was%20a%20reality%20star%20on%2016%20%26amp%3b%20Pregnant%20but%20now%20I%27m%20a%20goat%20milk%20farmer-%20and%20I%20don%27t%20regret%20leaving%20the" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html&title=I%20was%20a%20reality%20star%20on%2016%20%26amp%3b%20Pregnant%20but%20now%20I%27m%20a%20goat%20milk%20farmer-%20and%20I%20don%27t%20regret%20leaving%20the" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html&title=I%20was%20a%20reality%20star%20on%2016%20%26amp%3b%20Pregnant%20but%20now%20I%27m%20a%20goat%20milk%20farmer-%20and%20I%20don%27t%20regret%20leaving%20the" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fteen-mom-16-and-pregnant-jennifer-del-rio-farmer.html&description=I%20was%20a%20reality%20star%20on%2016%20%26amp%3b%20Pregnant%20but%20now%20I%27m%20a%20goat%20milk%20farmer-%20and%20I%20don%27t%20regret%20leaving%20the" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jonny-grays-girlfriend-list-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonny Grays Girlfriend: Who is Jonny Gray Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kristen-bells-daughters-guess-age-ahead-of-birthday-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristen Bells Daughters Guess Age Ahead of Birthday: Video">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
