I only paid it off when I got my first cheque from Go Compare.</p><p>"I’m in a very privileged position where people will pay me to do what I love doing, and playing Gio Compario is the best job I’ve ever had in my life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NINTCHDBPICT000612904434-1-e1602081606860.jpg><p>"I can’t tell you how much, but it’s changed my life."</p><p>Wynne said he "owes everything" to those adverts.</p><p>As well as paying off debts, the paycheck allowed him to buy a Mercedes ML 4x4 for £45,000 and a&nbsp;£30,000 Mercedes convertible with red seats.</p><p>While Gio is instantly recognisable, the singer does look a lot less barmy in real life, but he admitted that he’s never had to wear a fat suit for the role.</p><p>While Wynne’s character comically riles up the audience with his exasperating jingle, the experienced singer has entertained thousands on stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

music?</h2><p>The expert opera singer honed his craft at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama before attending the National Opera Studio.</p><p>After landing the Go Compare deal, Wynne was cast in the 25th Anniversary production of The Phantom of the Opera, which was performed at the Royal Albert Hall.</p><p>Not only has Wynne proved a success on the theatrical stage, he’s also an accomplished recording artist.</p><p>In 2011, he released his debut album, A Song in My Heart.</p><p>Thankfully, his own tunes went down a lot better than the Go Compare commercials, as his album shot straight to the number one spot in the UK Classical Charts.</p><p>The flamboyant singer has also made a name for himself presenting on BBC Radio Wales, where he had his own show: Wynne Evans, Big Welsh Weekend.</p><p>In 2012, Wynne featured on podcast The Guide to Opera, which was broadcast on Classic FM, where he’s since become a regular host.</p><img
