The former aesthetics model has uploaded several videos detailing how when it comes to health that low bodyfat percentages and striations don't necessarily mean a person is more in shape than someone who doesn't look like a comic book character.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He drove this point further home in a viral clip that's garnered over 974,000 views on the popular social media platform. In it, he posted a response to another user's video showing a woman with a protruding belly performing a series of rapid standing cleans and jerks in what looks like a Crossfit style gym.</p><p>The woman he highlights in his video is actually a fitness influencer and Crossfit enthusiast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">named Beth</a> who regularly posts her own content to TikTok. She touts herself as a plus-size athlete and regularly posts clips that dispel the idea one needs to look a certain way in order to excel in physical fitness</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The video serves to dispel the rumor that the aesthetics of a person determines how fit they are, something that Ben discusses at length in his TikTok while offering up his remarks on the comments section of Beth, who recorded herself performing multiple repetitions of the exercise.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bdccarpenter href=#>@bdccarpenter</a><p>Replying to @shelbs having a six pack is not fitness. Once again, I am tagged in a video where too many people feel comfortable insulting someone based on their body fat percentage. What @Sporty Beth CrossFit said isn’t even controversial. *Being* fit and *looking* fit are not the same thing. Many powerlifters and olympic lifters have high body fat percentages, but their sport requires them to lift X amount of weight. That is their sport. Many martial artists are not very muscular and can also have high body fat percentages, but they would decimate bodybuilders with no fight experience. Obviously, this is not to say that NOBODY who practices bodybuilding isn’t also fit. You can absolutely do both. It’s just worth keeping in mind that chasing aesthetics and chasing fitness are not always the same thing. And, I am frankly very sick of seeing really good people being insulted on their fitness videos just because they don’t look a certain way. Because if actual athletes get insulted for the way they look when they exercise, should we be surprised that so many regular people find gyms intimidating environments to be in? I propose not. P.S. my best-selling book, ‘Everything Fat Loss’ is currently on sale at Barnes and Noble, Apple, Kobo, Google, and at Amazon with an extra 29% off in Canada.

But what he said is a fact. This is a photo of me," he says, pointing to a picture of himself shirtless, gripping two 45lb dumbbells looking positively shredded.</p><p>"Many people would say that I look fit. But at the time I didn't do any cardio or play any sports. I was good at lifting weights...at a controlled tempo...in the 6-15 rep range. But my agility and fitness levels sucked.

But Crossfit, martial arts, powerlifting, Olympic lifting, etc. are sports based on what your body can do."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"And many of these athletes might not look lean and muscular but that doesn't make them any worse at what they do. I would bet decent money that I couldn't go toe-to-toe with her at CrossFit. Remember, having a visible six pack is not the epitome of actual fitness and we should uplift people who are exercising, not insult people who don't look a certain way while they are doing it."</p><p>Several commenters who replied to Ben's video stated that they were aware of Beth's profile and had nothing but praise for the feats of athleticism she put on display on her account: "I've watched her crossfit I'm breathless just watching !!" one person posted.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Another said that they couldn't believe the hate that Beth received simply for posting fitness-related content online: "I feel bad for Beth. She’s a very strong and powerful athlete. The amount of hate the poor woman gets is shocking."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another said that this was simply par the course for some sports and that Beth's body type is a lot more common in various weight-centric sports programs than people might think: "These people obviously haven’t seen some Olympians and professional athletes in some sports"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>And then there were those who said that this was just a common case of people talking smack on the internet without having the slightest idea as to what they're commenting on: "I feel like the people making the cruellest comments could not go toe to toe with her. she's amazing"</p><p>One other person said that there's a clear difference between gym strength and real world strength: "My partner owns a scaffolding company and has a lot of gym guys come cause they think it’s easy… they usually quit after 3 hours"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnrunuNSepZydomKzprjTZpmerKSav27Dx56lZqSVqMBuvsipp56c</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html&text=Influencer%20Felt%20Better%20When%20He%20Was%20Less%20Ripped&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html&title=Influencer%20Felt%20Better%20When%20He%20Was%20Less%20Ripped" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html&title=Influencer%20Felt%20Better%20When%20He%20Was%20Less%20Ripped" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html&title=Influencer%20Felt%20Better%20When%20He%20Was%20Less%20Ripped" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finfluencer-felt-better-when-less-ripped.html&description=Influencer%20Felt%20Better%20When%20He%20Was%20Less%20Ripped" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lil-loaded-20000801-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lil Loaded (Rapper) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bayless-conley.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Bayless Conley net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
