including his tattoos and what they mean.</p><h2>Who is PewDiePie?</h2><p>Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg is the man behind the nickname PewDiePie.</p><p>Born October 24, 1989 - he is a <a href=#>Swedish</a> YouTuber, best known for his Let's Play videos and his comedic style.</p><p>Felix was born and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden - &nbsp;to his mother Lotta Kristine Johanna and father, Ulf Christian Kjellberg.</p><p>His mother, a former&nbsp;chief information officer, was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden and his father is a corporate executive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Capture-ap-6469-5.jpg><p>He also has an older sister named Fanny.</p><p>During his childhood, Felix had a passion for art and video games - and would regularly draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on PewDiePie">Read More on PewDiePie</h2><p>His love for gaming continued throughout high school - where he frequently skipped classes to play video games with his friends at an Internet cafe.</p><p>During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with the money he made selling artwork in a gallery that is grandmother owned.</p><p>Kjellberg then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at&nbsp;Chalmers University of Technology&nbsp;in Gothenburg - but left the university in 2011.</p><p>In 2010, he created <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his YouTube channel PewDiePie</a> - where he focused on video game commentaries, most notably of horror and action video games.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Following his exit from university, his family refused to fund him - so he began to fund his early videos by working as a harbor captain, selling prints of his Photoshop art, and working at a hot dog stand.</p><p>In 2011, he began posting weekly vlogs - documenting his lifestyle.</p><p>By December 2011, Kjellberg's channel had around 60,000 subscribers.</p><p>Over the years the content creator continued to make videos - and his following continued to grow bigger than he could have ever imagined.</p><p>From 2014 to 2017, PewDiePie&nbsp;had the most viewed&nbsp;YouTube&nbsp;channel on the platform.</p><p>In 2022, he now has an eye-water 111 million subscribers on his channel - and much of his content follows his move to <a href=#>Japan</a>, with his wife Marzia.</p><p>His annual income is estimated at £78.9million - making him the <a href=#>site's top earner</a>.</p><h2>How many tattoos does PewDiePie have?</h2><p>PewDiePie is a lover of expressing himself through body art and has a total of six tattoos on both of his arms - each of which hold a deep meaning.</p><p>PewDiePie hasn’t kept his body art a secret - and his ink can be seen showcased on his social media accounts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Capture-ap-6469-4.jpg><p>The YouTuber also openly discussed his tattoos during his chat with the YouTube channel&nbsp;Cold Ones Clips, in June 2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are the meanings behind PewDiePie's tattoos?</h2><p>Like most tattoos, there is a personal meaning behind the design.</p><p>And PewDiePie's are no different - his six tattoos utilise a few different styles to produce interesting designs that are informed by his love of art and pop culture.</p><p>Here's what each piece of ink means.</p><h3>Frog with trumpet</h3><p>Located on his left upper arm, PewDiePie has a tattoos a frog playing the trumpet.</p><p>Designed and inked by Osaka based artist,&nbsp;Haskey - the tattoo represents a tribute to a lost pet named Slippy.</p><p>On the Instagram post where he debuted the&nbsp;ink&nbsp;he included&nbsp;the caption, “A tribute to an&nbsp;ol’&nbsp;pal.”</p><h3>Swedish Church</h3><p>Parallel with his frog tattoo is a Swedish Church, located on his on his right&nbsp;upper arm, facing&nbsp;out.</p><p>He got this tattoo done in Stokholm on Christmas 2016.</p><p>The church with&nbsp;something lurking in the steeple is reminiscent of classic children’s fairy tales and more&nbsp;modern&nbsp;illustrations from&nbsp;Where the Wild&nbsp;Things Are.</p><p>Designed and applied by&nbsp;Will Pacheco - the piece is believed to be symbolic of PewDiePie’s childhood in Sweden.</p><h3>Skeleton riding cat</h3><p>Based on the inside of his right bicep is a depiction of a skeleton figure riding a leaping cat.</p><p>The design is believed to be a tribute to famous artist&nbsp;Gary Baseman’s&nbsp;dead cat, Stubby - after Baseman painted a piece entitled DAMN YOU ALL,&nbsp;as a way to&nbsp;commerate a lost friend - and&nbsp;PewDiePie loved it.</p><h3>Girl tattoo</h3><p>It appears that PewDiePie likes to pay tributes to artists and their work in his ink - and this is exactly what he did with this tattoo.</p><p>Located on his right forearm, facing forward - the design comes from the collection of figures and motifs that American artist&nbsp;KAWS&nbsp;created over the past thirty years.&nbsp;</p><h3>Heart shaped face with crying eyes</h3><p>Unlike his other tattoos, this one doesn't appear to be in the cartoon style PewDiePie likes.</p><p>Located on his left forearm, this tattoos&nbsp;uses&nbsp;&nbsp;black ink and negative space to create a grimacing face and below is an eye that draws inspiration from early tattoo flash.</p><p>Tattooed by artist,&nbsp;Luciano, in <a href=#>London</a>&nbsp;back in 2016 - PewDiePie has admitted that this particular tattoo is not associated with any deeper meaning.</p><p>Instead, he found Luciano on Instagram and was enamoured by his work.</p><h3>Naked woman and skeleton embrace</h3><p>His final tattoo is the largest piece he has on his body - and it's the one design that draws strongest on traditional elements of classic tattooing.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Applied using black ink and negative space - this piece depicts a nude woman and a skeleton in some sort of embrace.</p><p>When asked about the meaning of this piece, PewDiePie said: “I think I had a reason when I got them, but clearly I don’t remember any of it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huYGmEdHyRaKuarKSkvLR5z56unaGVpbameceormalkaPGbsPHmqtmpZWWu6q6xqxm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html&text=How%20many%20tattoos%20does%20PewDiePie%20have%20and%20what%20are%20their%20meanings%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html&title=How%20many%20tattoos%20does%20PewDiePie%20have%20and%20what%20are%20their%20meanings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html&title=How%20many%20tattoos%20does%20PewDiePie%20have%20and%20what%20are%20their%20meanings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html&title=How%20many%20tattoos%20does%20PewDiePie%20have%20and%20what%20are%20their%20meanings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftattoos-pewdiepie-how-many-what-meanings.html&description=How%20many%20tattoos%20does%20PewDiePie%20have%20and%20what%20are%20their%20meanings%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sean-young-pics-actress-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pics Of The Blade Runner Actress  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./glee-star-becca-tobins-boyfriend-found-dead-top-5-stories-2014117.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Glee Star Becca Tobin's Boyfriend Found Dead: Top 5 Stories">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
