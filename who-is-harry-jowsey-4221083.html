The Netflix reality star, 26, was one of the season 32 contestants, and he was partnered with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rylee Arnold</strong></a>. For their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season 32 premiere performance</a>, Harry and Rylee danced a cha cha to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Timberlake’s</strong> </a>“Rock Your Body” and scored a 12 out of 30. Their dance has since gone viral on social media.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>For <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Latin Night</a>, their salsa earned a 15 out of 30. The pair survived <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Motown Night</a> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Disney Night</a>. Harry and Rylee’s contemporary for Most Memorable Year Night didn’t earn the highest scores, but they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>survived the elimination</a>. Following Monster Night and Whitney Houston Night, Harry and Rylee tackled <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor Swift Night</a>. However, the pair was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shockingly eliminated</a> at the end of the November 21 episode.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Just days after the second episode of DWTS, Harry and Rylee were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted holding hands</a> at the Hollywood Palladium. Their outing continued to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spark romance rumors</a> about the DWTS pair. They’ve continued to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fuel speculation</a> with adorable TikTok and sweet photos. Rylee recently gushed on Instagram that she’s “so proud of him [Harry] and so grateful to have him in my life!!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/harry-jowsey-update-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Harry’s charm and adorable personality made DWTS viewers fall in love with him. If you’re not familiar with Too Hot to Handle, <strong>Hollywood Life</strong> has rounded up 5 key things you need to know about Harry and his DWTS journey.</p><h2>Harry Is an Australian Reality Star and Influencer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Harry is originally from Australia, where his family has a large farm. He currently resides in Los Angeles. Harry has appeared on relationship reality shows like New Zealand’s Heartbreak Island&nbsp;in 2018 and on Netflix’s hit show Too Hot To Handle.</p><h2>Harry Rose to Fame on Too Hot To Handle</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Too Hot to Handle became an obsession among fans and even celebrities around the globe. Viewers quickly latched onto Harry’s charm, sexy accent, odd phrases, and those chiseled abs. Harry found love with one of the show’s cast members, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Francesca Farago.</strong></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Harry and Francesca left the show in a romantic relationship, but they broke up just 8 months later. However, the couple reconciled in May 2020. Harry proposed to Francesca during the Too Hot to Handle reunion show. Their reconciliation didn’t last long, and they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>split for good</a> in June 2020. Francesca later revealed in a Q&A that she and Harry had “zero contact” with one another.</p><h2>Harry Has Been Linked to a Number of Celebs</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>While his relationship with Francesca didn’t work out, Harry hasn’t wasted any time getting back out on the dating scene. He notably hooked up with Too Hot to Handle co-star <strong>Madison Wyborny</strong> after his first breakup with Francesca. Harry dated Too Hot To Handle alum <b>Georgia Hassarati </b>for a year. He accused Georgia of cheating during his appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast and said he’ll be ready for “kids, marriage, and a nice house” soon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>He has also been spotted out with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie Jenner’s</strong></a> BFF <strong>Stassie Karanikolaou</strong>,&nbsp;YouTube star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tana Mongeau</strong></a>, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Larsa Pippen</strong></a>. He went on a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dinner date</a> with the RHOM star, who is 20 years his senior, in October 2020.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Before Harry and Rylee were spotted out holding hands, they were asked about their relationship status following the October 3 episode. “We just enjoy hanging out, and we love each other, so it’s been great,” Harry told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET</a>. He cryptically added, “Keep the mystery in it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/harry-jowsey-update-emebd.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>However, the reality star admitted to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that the dating speculation has been “a little bit unfair on Rylee.” He added, “She’s so green to this whole world and everyone having an opinion, and stuff like that.” Harry went on to say that “whatever happens, happens. We’re just enjoying being together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>No matter what their relationship status is, Harry and Rylee are close friends. After receiving criticism for their low scores, Harry <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>took to Snapchat</a> to defend Rylee.&nbsp;“I just want to say, today has been extremely difficult,” he said. “Poor Rylee is really upset, I’m really upset. I think we’re both equally devastated and upset about last night, ’cause it wasn’t our night, wasn’t our best dance. And, obviously, the comments and everyone online kind of reflects that as well.” He later added, “It’s not very nice to read and today was really difficult for both of us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hollywood Life</strong> spoke exclusively</a> with Harry about some of the criticism he and Rylee have received about their run in the competition. “I honestly do appreciate people hating us now because at least they’re emotionally invested in watching us, and they want to see us lose,” Harry said. “So that means they’re going to watch the show and that’s great. That’s a win for everyone.”</p><h2>Harry Has Opened Up About His Mental Health Struggles</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>“I used to cut the top of my arm instead of the underneath. There is a scar there,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Telegraph</a>. “I used to do the top of my arms because I didn’t want my parents to think that I was sad.” Despite his dark periods, Harry admitted that “there’s never been a moment where I’ve been like, I’m going to end it all now. There has always been light.”</p><h2>Harry Has His Own Candle Line</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>He also owns the luxury candle line The Ritual. He also has a clothing brand. The name of his clothing brand is called Naughty Possums, a phrase Harry often used on Too Hot to Handle.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K1or7RsmSjp6eosrp5k2tpamhoaHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html&text=Who%20Is%20Harry%20Jowsey%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Reality%20Star%20on%20DWTS%20Season%2032%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html&title=Who%20Is%20Harry%20Jowsey%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Reality%20Star%20on%20DWTS%20Season%2032%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html&title=Who%20Is%20Harry%20Jowsey%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Reality%20Star%20on%20DWTS%20Season%2032%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html&title=Who%20Is%20Harry%20Jowsey%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Reality%20Star%20on%20DWTS%20Season%2032%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-harry-jowsey-4221083.html&description=Who%20Is%20Harry%20Jowsey%3f%20Get%20to%20Know%20the%20Reality%20Star%20on%20DWTS%20Season%2032%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-kevin-ortiz-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Kevin Ortiz Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-vampire-diaries-season-8-episode-9-recap-miss-mystic-falls-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Vampire Diaries Season 8 Episode 9 Recap: Miss Mystic Falls 2.0">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
