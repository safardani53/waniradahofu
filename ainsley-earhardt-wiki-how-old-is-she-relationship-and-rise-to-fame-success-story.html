However, there is no actual evidence to back up this theory.&nbsp;Both Hannity and Earnhardt have openly refuted the reports, preferring to concentrate on their own businesses rather than personal gossip.</p><p>Ainsley Earhardt’s Personal Life From 2012 until 2018, Ainsley Earhardt was married to Will Proctor.
