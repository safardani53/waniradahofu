The formula is gentle enough to use every day and it doesn’t have the medicinal scent that some dandruff shampoos have.

The Klorane dry shampoo was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a verified winner out of the 21 we tested</a> because it absorbed into our tester’s scalp beautifully without drying it out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While it initially has a white cast upon spraying it, this residue disappears when you massage it into your scalp and it absorbs the oil there.

It’s kind of like the old trick of rubbing a dryer sheet on clothes to avoid static — it takes the charge out of the equation. Plus, that feature can be turned on and off depending on your preference and hair type. Though it’s designed and advertised to work on all hair types, we found the best success with fine and wavy hair, rather than thicker strands.

For dry shampoos we ran coconut oil through our strands to see how the formulas absorbed it. With traditional shampoos, we considered the desired aims — whether to reduce oil, dandruff, or hair thinning — and evaluated if they worked in those areas. We tested qualities like feel, look, leftover residue, scent, and performance for this category of testing.</li><li><strong>Hair Treatments: </strong>In our tests for treatments such as hair masks or hair oils, we did real world tests using these products in testers’ daily routines. We applied the products while the hair was still wet, and then dried it, considering how the hair looked and felt before and after the product was applied.</li><li><strong>Brushes: </strong>For actual brushes, our team looked at performance, considering things like hair breakage, shedding prevention, ease of use, and comfort. For scalp massagers, our testers used these tools during and after showers to apply an assortment of products to their scalp (such as oils, masks, etc.), and considered how the massager helped with soapy lathers, absorption, and more.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Heat Protectant: </strong>We tested dozens of heat protectants both in the lab and over a two-week period in testers’ homes. We took into account the various conditions needed for each spray, whether intended for wet hair or dry, and then dried the hair and used a hot tool such as a straightener or curling iron. Our team also used the heat protectants on toast to see the protection at work in a more immediate visual way.</li><li><strong>Hot Tools: </strong>For hair dryers, flat irons, and rotating curling irons, our team tested how well each performed for its intended purpose or style. In some cases, we used hairstylists to get the best results and then followed up with additional home testing to make sure the tools were user-friendly for all levels. We looked at heat settings, maneuverability, and performance in these product categories.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Clip-in Hair Extensions:</strong> We did two tests for clip-in extensions — one in the lab led by professional hairstylists and one at home where our testers put the extensions in by themselves. We noted how the fit and comfort of each extension was, how easy they were to attach, and how they looked.</li><li><strong>At-Home Laser Hair Removal: </strong>Working between 13 popular at-home laser hair removal devices we prioritized safety and ease of use.

Both of our expert hairstylists mentioned Olaplex by name when recommending treatments that can improve the hair’s quality. “I always recommend for my clients to do a bond builder like Olaplex once a week,” says Joseph Michael. “For any hair type you should take vitamins or use products that have hair bonders built in like K18 or Olaplex to restore damaged hair,” agrees Julius Michael.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best way to style hair without damaging it?</span></p><p>To style your hair without damaging it, it’s important to use a combination of good treatments and tools. “Make sure you’re using good heat protectants such as leave-in detanglers,” says Joseph Michael, cautioning against hot tools “that get too hot for your hair texture.” Those with fine hair should be extra careful when choosing a heat setting because this hair type is more delicate than others.</p><p>But damage can happen with skin sensitivities as well as from preparation with the wrong cleaning agents. “If you have a sensitive scalp, you’ll want to use a natural or organic product line,” suggests Julius Michael. He also recommends shampoos and conditioners without “unwanted chemicals.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Are there certain ingredients that make for a better shampoo or conditioner than others?</span></p><p>Joseph Michael suggests looking for vitamin E oil and rosemary oil. “Both strengthen the hair and help with hair growth,” he says. “I like to stay away from products that have too much alcohol which can dry out the hair and make it look a little brittle.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Madison Yauger</a> is a senior shopping writer with extensive experience writing about beauty, with special attention to hair products.
