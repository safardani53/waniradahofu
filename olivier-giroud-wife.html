The French athlete is over a decade into his career and showed how dedicated he is to his <a href=#>sport</a> at the high-stakes event.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the World Cup began in December 2022, Olivier became France’s underdog as a last-minute replacement for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Karim Benzema</a> after Karim suffered an injury. While he wasn’t the competition’s first choice, Olivier earned soccer fans’ respect through his selfless attitude toward his teammates. Not to mention his talents made France a leading contender in the competition, as he scored the winning goal against England in December 2022.</p><p>Olivier’s stellar World Cup victories resulted in the 36-year-old soccer player France's all-time top goal-scorer of the Qatar competition. He will celebrate the coveted title with his devoted wife and family.

It’s unclear how the couple met, but multiple sources reported that Jennifer was born in the United States, though the couple moved to London during their marriage. The 38-year-old soccer wife was also born on September 25, 1984, making her two years older than her husband.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jennifer doesn’t work in the entertainment and sports industry and seemingly lives a private life. Her Instagram account is currently private, and she hasn’t updated her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter profile</a> in over two years. Although Jennifer has strived for a more quiet life than her husband, their marriage had a public scandal in 2014.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>, Olivier got into hot water during his run with the Arsenals in the UK. The night before the team’s ​​2-0 victory over Crystal Palace, Olivier reportedly took a “female companion” named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celia Kay</a> back to his room at the Four Seasons.</p><p>Initially, Olivier denied bringing Celia to his hotel room, and the model reacted by sharing a photo of him in his hotel room wearing nothing but a pair of briefs. Celia also posted a snap of herself wearing lingerie in the hotel room’s bathroom.</p><p>Eventually, Olivier confessed to being with Celia the night before his game. He admitted to making a “mistake” with Celia but denied any adulterous acts. Then, Olivier took to Twitter to apologize to Jennifer and his former boss, the Arsenals CEO, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arsene Wenger</a>.</p><p>“I apologise to my wife, family and friends, and my manager, team-mates and Arsenal fans," Olivier <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in 2014. “I now have to fight for my family and for my club and obtain their forgiveness. Nothing else matters at the moment.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jennifer reportedly remained silent during Olivier’s scandal. However, they seemingly worked through the alleged infidelity and are still married.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Olivier Giroud have any kids?</h2><p>Olivier seemingly kept his promise to “fight for my family,” after his public extramarital activity. Following his apology to Jennifer, the couple moved forward with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">growing their family</a>. Before the scandal, Olivier and Jennifer welcomed their first child, Jade, in 2013. Three years later, Jennifer gave birth to the couple’s son, Evan. Then, in 2018 and 2020, they welcomed another boy and girl — Aaron and Aria.</p><p>Olivier and Jennifer take their kids along with them at many of the athlete’s notable events. In December 2022, Olivier posted several pictures of him and Jennifer attending the World Cup with their little ones.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In addition to being passionate about his wife and kids, Olivier doesn’t shy away from his <a href=#>religious upbringing</a>. The athlete tattooed “Dominus regit me et nihil mihi deerit,” on his left arm early in his career, which can be translated to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Psalm 23 reference</a> “The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.” Olivier said he intentionally gives thanks to God for any accolade he receives, like his 2018 World Cup win.</p><p>“I’m very religious so, at that moment, I just thanked God,” Olivier said in a 2019 interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>. “I was very grateful to have the opportunity to live my dream. To live every single day for me is a day blessed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmqwsieqWafmae8trCMsKCfnQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html&text=Olivier%20Giroud%20and%20His%20Wife%20Have%20Had%20Some%20Ups%20and%20Downs&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html&title=Olivier%20Giroud%20and%20His%20Wife%20Have%20Had%20Some%20Ups%20and%20Downs" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html&title=Olivier%20Giroud%20and%20His%20Wife%20Have%20Had%20Some%20Ups%20and%20Downs" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html&title=Olivier%20Giroud%20and%20His%20Wife%20Have%20Had%20Some%20Ups%20and%20Downs" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2folivier-giroud-wife.html&description=Olivier%20Giroud%20and%20His%20Wife%20Have%20Had%20Some%20Ups%20and%20Downs" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrities-wearing-santa-costumes-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Photos of Sexy Looks  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./natalie-dormer-sophie-turner-maisie-williams-and-pedro-pascal.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Dormer, Sophie Turner, Maisie Williams and Pedro Pascal">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
