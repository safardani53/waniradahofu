His personal wealth is estimated to be between USD 100-120k.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>According to accounts, Ryan Keeler was only six years old when his father gave him a football for his bday. He began practicing football every day and had no idea when his pastime turned into his enthusiasm for becoming a renowned football player. He announced on Facebook that he has enrolled in Next Level Sports QB Instruction for football preparation.</p><p>During high school, he used to play paired and at the neighborhood level. Following high school, he started receiving scholarship offers from prestigious colleges such as the Virginia Cavaliers, West Virginia Mountaineers, and others.
