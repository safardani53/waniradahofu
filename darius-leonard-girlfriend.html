Education</h2><p>Kayla Michelle Sanderson was born in 1994 to her parents, Timothy and Aimee Sanderson, in South Carolina, United States.</p><p>Sanderson, whom her family and close ones call Kay, grew up in the small town named Lake View with her two sisters, Taylor and Carson.</p><p>She did her primary level schooling in a local private school before she attended Lake View High School for high school education.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kayla-Sanderson-and-her-father-Timothy-e1663727690182.jpg><p>Like her other two sisters, Kay was bright in her studies and excelled academically. Aside from course studies, Kay was athletic and enjoyed playing ball games.</p><p>She liked all sorts of games, mostly volleyball, softball, and basketball.</p><p>After high school graduation, Sanderson briefly attended Florence Darlington Technical College. She later went to Claflin University in Orangeburg and played softball for her college team.</p><p>Kayla graduated with a bachelor’s degree in Human Performance and Recreation studies from the University.&nbsp;</p><h2>Darius Leonard Girlfriend | Career</h2><p>After college, Kayla started working as a ninth-grade algebra teacher in a private school back in her hometown in South Carolina.</p><p>She had taken up that tiresome job to support herself and Darius, who was away in Tampa at that time preparing himself for the upcoming NFL draft.</p><p>Kay continued doing her teaching job even after she and Leonard got married.</p><p>However, she later came to live with her husband after she got pregnant with their first girl. What she is doing now remains unknown.</p><h2>Darius Leonard Girlfriend | Age & Body Measurements</h2><p>According to Fabwags, Kayla was born in 1995, a year before her husband Darius, so she is currently in her late twenties.</p><p>Regarding her physical features, Kayla has become chubbier than in the past. As Darius has gained some muscles because of his routine workouts, the couple looks perfect whenever they show up together.</p><p>Kayla is taller than the average American woman and stands approximately 1.67 meters (5 feet 6 inches) tall.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also Read About <a href=#>Dak Prescott’s Girlfriend Natalie Buffett Bio: Career & Net worth</a></strong></p><h2>Darius Leonard Girlfriend | Her Life With The NFL Star</h2><h3>Beginning of a Relationship</h3><p>Born and raised in the small town of Lake View, Kayla and Darius attended the same kindergarten as kids. It was probably in the late nineties when they began their companionship.</p><p>Kayla remembers that they were probably 5 or 6, Darius was slightly younger, and they were in the same class.</p><p>They learned their lessons, played games, and took pictures together.</p><p>As time passed by, Darius began developing feelings for her. The most striking thing for him about her was her blue eyes.&nbsp;</p><p>He did not know it was love until they reached middle school. When they were in the sixth grade, he approached her for the first time with his proposal, but she rejected him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Darius-Leonard-Girlfriend-Game.jpg><p>However, the interaction between the two never stopped. The two always corresponded as friends, often hung out, and went out to watch many local ball games together.</p><p>In fact, like Darius, Kayla, too, had extraordinary athletic abilities, so they talked about each other’s games, achievements, and everything the two were passionate about at that time.</p><p>Eventually, while they were in their eleventh grade, something unexpected happened. While Kay and Darius were at their friend’s house for a party, she asked him out, which he accepted immediately.</p><p>After that event, they never separated. The two began a romantic relationship, happily ending up in marriage after around seventeen years of dating.</p><h3>Marriage</h3><p>Like every lover on Earth, Darius wanted Kayla to marry and be with him for the rest of his life. On the other hand, Kayla, too, was sure Darius was the only man in her life whom she deemed fit to be her life partner.</p><p>Kay always dreamed of getting married in a big ceremony with all the close ones and her friends beside her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Darius-Leonard-and-Kayla-at-their-wedding-e1663727458352.jpg><p>However, they could not wait much longer. After some weeks of the NFL draft, the two wed without any arrangement.</p><p>While Darius was in his workout dress, Kay was in her school teacher’s uniform as she had directly headed to the wedding spot from work.</p><p>Still, they were happy that their love life had reached a milestone, and it was the beginning of the following important chapter of their life together.</p><p>Much later in 2019, the couple rehosted their marriage ceremony in attendance of their family members, friends, and close ones, but it was grand this time.</p><h3>Kids</h3><p>The Colts linebacker and his wife Kay have two beautiful daughters.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gender-Reveal.jpg><p>Their first daughter, Mia, was born on March 29, 2019.
