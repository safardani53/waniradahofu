His father, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>John Bennett Perry</a>, was an actor and model — the younger Perry even guest-starred in an episode of his dad’s cop show 240-Robert in 1979.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry moved to Los Angeles as a teenager. After landing a few TV guest spots, he recurred as Chazz Russell on Boys Will Be Boys from 1987 to 1988. Roles on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Growing Pains</a> and Sydney followed, but his big break came in 1994 with NBC’s iconic sitcom Friends.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>From left: Matthew Perry, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Jennifer Aniston, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry played sarcastic commitment-phobe Chandler Bing for 10 seasons, landing an Emmy nomination in 2002. Friends was the hottest show of the 90s, with Perry and costars <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Courteney Cox</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lisa Kudrow</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Matt LeBlanc</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>David Schwimmer</a> ultimately earning a whopping $1 million each per episode.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was 24 when I got on the show,” Perry said in the 2004 book <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Friends … ‘Til the End</a>. “I’ll be 34 when it’s over, and those are really important years in somebody’s life. So to do it all in public … was difficult. At first you have the wave of ‘I’m famous, and this is exactly what I’ve wanted my whole life.’ But then you go through the whole recluse stage where you think, ‘I wish everybody would stop staring at me.’ And then you eventually, hopefully, get through all that. You find things in your life that are grounding, like your family and good friends.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite his success, Perry struggled with addiction behind the scenes, seeking treatment 15 times over the years. He told Britain’s BBC Radio 2 in 2016 that he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>didn’t remember filming</a> seasons 3 through 6 of Friends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 2013 PEOPLE cover story, the actor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>admitted to abusing alcohol and Vicodin</a>, which a doctor had prescribed him after a 1997 Jet Ski accident.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had a big problem with alcohol and pills and I couldn’t stop,” he said. “Eventually things got so bad that I couldn’t hide it, and then everybody knew.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Then, “something clicked,” and he founded Perry House, a men’s sober living facility, in his old Malibu beach home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“The interesting reason that I can be so helpful to people now is that I screwed up so often,” he said. “It’s nice for people to see that somebody who once struggled in their life is not struggling any more.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Friends Cast.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Reisig & Taylor/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Back in 2015, he was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>honored for his advocacy</a> by the treatment center Phoenix House, telling The Hollywood Reporter, “You can’t have a drug problem for 30 years and then expect to have it be solved in 28 days.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead of the release of his memoir <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing</a> last, the actor told PEOPLE that he credited his&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;castmates with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>rallying around him</a> amid his addiction, he explained, "They were understanding, and they were patient."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's like penguins. In nature, when one is sick or very injured, the other penguins surround it and prop it up and walk around until that penguin can walk on its own. And that's kind of what the cast did for me," he added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The friendships he made with the cast have proven to be lifelong, which was evident when they came together for the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>2021 HBO Max reunion show</a>. He said, "It's a group that really is close and tight-knit and loves each other."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Friends ended in 2004, Perry struggled to find another small-screen hit: his next starring vehicle, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Aaron Sorkin</a>’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip</a> aired on NBC for just 22 episodes from 2006-07.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He co-created Mr. Sunshine in 2011, but ABC canceled the comedy after nine episodes. His NBC comedy Go On ran for one season in 2013. Next, he starred alongside Thomas Lennon on CBS’s The Odd Couple reboot for three seasons from 2015-17.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry also performed in the play The End of Longing in London beginning in 2016 in addition to film credits including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Fools Rush In</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>The Whole Nine Yards</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Serving Sara</a> and 17 Again.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his memoir, the actor discussed his health struggles, including a frightening experience in which&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he was hospitalized for five months</a>&nbsp;after his colon ruptured as a result of using OxyContin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The doctors told my family that I had a two-percent chance to live. That's the time I really came close to my life ending," Perry told PEOPLE about the terrifying experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the event, Perry revealed that he went into a coma for two weeks, and when he awoke, he had a colostomy bag that he had to use for about a year. The experience led Perry to one of his greatest resolutions — to stop taking prescription opioids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My therapist said, 'The next time you think about taking OxyContin, just think about having a colostomy bag for the rest of your life,' " he said. "And a little window opened, and I crawled through it, and I no longer want OxyContin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to gratitude, Perry said he learned that "everything starts with sobriety. Because if you don't have sobriety, you're going to lose everything that you put in front of it, so my sobriety is right up there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ52WwbW0xLBkqZ2ip8ZusMSam2aZpGKCdXmWbmdqcWln</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html&text=Matthew%20Perry%20Dead%3a%20%27Friends%27%20Star%20Was%2054&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html&title=Matthew%20Perry%20Dead%3a%20%27Friends%27%20Star%20Was%2054" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html&title=Matthew%20Perry%20Dead%3a%20%27Friends%27%20Star%20Was%2054" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html&title=Matthew%20Perry%20Dead%3a%20%27Friends%27%20Star%20Was%2054" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmatthew-perry-dead-at-54-7501992.html&description=Matthew%20Perry%20Dead%3a%20%27Friends%27%20Star%20Was%2054" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reem-acra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Reem Acra- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Husband, Career">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./scott-brown-dj.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Scott Brown (DJ) net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
