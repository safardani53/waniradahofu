In the early 20th century there was even a salary cap... No such restrictions these days.</p><p>With the transfer rumours swirling amidst another summer of activity, <a href=#>SunSport</a> investigates just how and where the wage bills started getting out of control...</p><p>Let's start at the beginning. The very beginning in fact: 1879.</p><p>Back in the 1870s, football was a purely amateur pastime, played on pitches and greens across the country.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fergus-suter.jpg><p>Yet even then it wasn't immune to scandal, as the importance of winning - the ultimate driving force behind money in sport these days - pushed people to break the law.</p><p>Back in 1879, Lancashire outfit Darwen were found to be paying two of their players - Scottish duo Fergie Suter and James Love.</p><p>And it was a continuing trend as many teams adopted the 'if you can't beat them, join them' philosophy, which ultimately led to the legalisation of professionalism in 1885.</p><p>Paying players was now not only legal, it was the norm. And it with wages spiralling out of control, reaching the £3-a-week mark, the league promptly introduced a restriction...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000001140399.jpg><p>No player was to be paid more than £4-a-week for their services. That's right, just <strong>FOUR</strong> pounds per week.</p><p>Throughout the next two decades, transfer fees rose - with <a href=#>Sunderland</a>'s Alf Common swapping the Black Cats for north-east rivals <a href=#>Middlesbrough</a> for a then staggering £1,000 in 1905.</p><p>As the trend of big-money moves continued, the league bumped up the weekly wage to £8 in 1922 - but only £6 through the summer when the season had ended.</p><p>With the wages rising, so did the transfer fees, as the first five-figure sum coming in 1928 when <a href=#>Arsenal</a> signed David Jack from Bolton.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/jonny-haynes.jpg><p>It took 20 years for another pay bump to come into effect, as Jimmy Guthrie took over as chairman of the Players' Union.</p><p>He ensured each player was eligible to take home £12-a-week and £10 in the summer - a 50 per cent boost.</p><p>However, 1961 was the turning point, as just 14 years after that hike, football saw its first £100-a-week player - Fulham's Jonny Haynes - as new PFA chairman Jimmy Hill scrapped the cap altogether.</p><p>A year later and the first ever £100,000 was paraded by <a href=#>Manchester United</a> after signing Denis Law from Torino.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>That was followed 17 years later in 1979 by the first £1million player as Trevor Francis was brought to Nottingham Forest.</p><p>In the same year, England goalkeeper <a href=#>Peter Shilton</a> became the highest paid player in Britain at a whopping £1,200-a-week.</p><p>It took 15 more years until any player hit the £10,000-a-week threshold - and it was Blackburn striker Chris Sutton on the staggering wage-bill.</p><p>And just a year later, Arsenal signed Dennis Bergkamp - with the world going beserk for his 'staggering' wages of £25,000-a-week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000001136147.jpg><p>Many players at the time were stunned by the salary, with England left-back Stuart Pearce even calling it a 'huge waste of money'.</p><p>It's incredible to think £25,000-a-week could spark such an uproar just 21 years ago.</p><p>In the same season, the Bosman ruling came into force - allowing out-of-contract players a free move, hence higher wages.</p><p>The following season even saw the £15m transfer fee shattered as <a href=#>Alan Shearer</a> joined Newcastle&nbsp;from former Premier League champions Blackburn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/roy-keane.jpg><p>It took Man United hard-man <a href=#>Roy Keane</a> to convince bosses to break the £50,000-a-week mark - doing so in 2000, while Sol Campbell quickly <strong>DOUBLED</strong> that a year later after infamously swapping <a href=#>Tottenham</a> for Arsenal on a free.</p><p>It would appear the turn of the millennium was the turning point in wage-bill history.</p><p>Suddenly £100-a-week had become £100,000 in the space of just 40 years - following a century of tiny wages.</p><p>Ever since, things have spiralled somewhat out of control.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000019134992.jpg><p><a href=#>Carlos Tevez</a> was the man to hit yet another milestone as he became the first £1m-a-month player - taking home a reported £286,000-a-week at 'nouveau riche'&nbsp;<a href=#>Manchester City</a>.</p><p>Since then the £300,000-a-week mark has been broken on a number of occasions - even in places such as the UAE and China, as new money dominates football.</p><p>Reports last summer even suggested Ezequiel Lavezzi is taking home an outrageous £400,000-a-week with Hebei China Fortune...</p><p>Scarily though, where does it end? 1961 saw the wage cap scrapped and the first £100-a-week player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000215182544.jpg><p>40 years later, that was <strong>ONE THOUSAND</strong> times higher. 15 years further down the line that new extraordinary sum has been quadrupled.</p><p>Although it seems absurd, it's time to embrace a very real possibility...
