I would recommend anyone to take him."</p><h2>'CAMPUS IS BUZZING ABOUT HIM!'</h2><p>Ben - whose soft-spoken nature was a winning contrast to his podium signature (BEN!) - has clearly come to play.</p><p>His first win was $17,000 - which would have been higher barring a gutsy $7000 Daily Double bet - his second win was a round $30,000, his third $23K.</p><p>Even <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, had to remark that Ben’s score during his debut was “all the more impressive given your big Daily Double wager in the first round.”</p><p>One fan wrote on Reddit: “WHAT a performance from my man Ben. Takes a huge loss on the first Daily Double, goes on to dominate the rest of the game, and wins in a runaway. A tour de force performance."</p><p>Another simply wrote: "Loved Ben. What a legend."</p><p>A third recently wrote: "I find it humorous that Ben seems to ring in at times without having the answer on the tip of his tongue. Then he'll think for a couple of seconds before blurting it out just before the buzzer."</p><p>A fourth person predicted: "I think Ben can become a&nbsp;<a href=#>super-champ</a>."</p><p>A fifth person wrote in the thread: "Dude teaches at my College, campus is buzzing about him right now."</p><p>A "super-champion" entails winning 10 games, which has not happened since the gentlemanly&nbsp;<a href=#>Ray LaLonde's 13-day streak</a>&nbsp;in January.</p><p>Some critics have joked about Ben's buzzer stance on Twitter since the ongoing winner holds his buzzer close to the vest quite literally.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>He clapped back tweeting an image of him clutching his signaling device: "As the old saying goes, 'show the buzzer kindness and the buzzer will respond in kind.'"</p><p>His Twitter bio reads: "Jeopardy April 12 2023 - ???"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/s-newest-star-ben-chan-809940873.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/champ-ben-chan-soars-3rd-809978835.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/Screen-Shot-2023-04-14-at-3.18.17-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvaGyCeX%2BWaKGep6CWv6XFjJucp2WTna6vedaipaedomLAtb7EmqJmm5%2BhuaazxGagp6yVp8OqsdZo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html&text=Jeopardy%21%27s%20newest%20star%20Ben%20Chan%20dishes%20show%20secrets%20and%20throws%20watch%20party%20for%20his%20college%20students&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html&title=Jeopardy%21%27s%20newest%20star%20Ben%20Chan%20dishes%20show%20secrets%20and%20throws%20watch%20party%20for%20his%20college%20students" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html&title=Jeopardy%21%27s%20newest%20star%20Ben%20Chan%20dishes%20show%20secrets%20and%20throws%20watch%20party%20for%20his%20college%20students" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html&title=Jeopardy%21%27s%20newest%20star%20Ben%20Chan%20dishes%20show%20secrets%20and%20throws%20watch%20party%20for%20his%20college%20students" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-ben-chan-winner-streak-college-interview.html&description=Jeopardy%21%27s%20newest%20star%20Ben%20Chan%20dishes%20show%20secrets%20and%20throws%20watch%20party%20for%20his%20college%20students" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./cynthia-bailey-wedding-dress-mike-hill-married-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="RHOA Star Looks Gorgeous In Gown  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-humberto-zurita-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Humberto Zurita Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
