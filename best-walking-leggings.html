The result? A pair of eco-friendly leggings that are incredibly sculpting and supportive — particularly around the waist, thanks to the thick, long waistband that doesn't roll down.</p><p>We felt very secure in these leggings and found them to be very flattering.</p><p>We love the simple black colour (but these are available in 13 other bold colours and prints too) and discrete logo, and would definitely wear these for the gym or running errands.</p><p>The only issue we had, and shoppers in the site's review section agreed, was that they're a little tricky to get on. Initially, we thought they weren't going to fit, but were pleasantly surprised when we wiggled into them and found they fit perfectly. ]</p><p>In fact, you want them to be this figure-hugging to make sure they don't fall down during an arduous workout and to emphasise your curves.</p><p>We were also pleased that, even though these were tight, there was no VPL.

What's not to love?</p><h2>Where to buy women's walking leggings in the UK</h2><p>Women's walking leggings are available at a range of high street shops and specific fitness brands in the UK, including:</p><h2>What should I look for in a pair of walking leggings?</h2><p>Let's start with the basics: when looking for a pair of walking leggings, comfort should always come first.</p><p>If a pair of leggings is cut from fabric that isn't soft, stretchy or flexible enough, you're going to struggle on long hikes.</p><p>In addition, moisture-wicking pairs will ensure that your leggings don't get sweaty and damp, or get any bacterial infections as they fester in moisture.</p><p>Many people find that high-waisted leggings provide more support for long walks too.</p><h2>How much do walking leggings cost?</h2><p>Walking leggings range in price, depending on which brand you get them from. You can find pairs for as cheap as £10, but the price will increase according to the quality. The more expensive pairs come from established brands like Sweaty Betty and Lululemon.</p><h2>What is the best material for hiking leggings?</h2><p>Polyester, sweat-wicking fabrics combined with elastane or Lycra and other breathable, four-way-stretch fabrics are the materials to look out for when shopping for leggings.</p><p>We advise steering clear of 100% cotton or wool, because you'll retain heat and sweat way too much.</p><h2>What are the best leggings for walking?</h2><p>From Sweaty Betty to Craghoppers and Odlo, loads of brands offer great options when it comes to leggings for walking.</p><p>Once you know the fabrics to look for and the reason you're buying, there's an array of fantastic products, many of which are mentioned above.</p><p>You should first consider the temperature of where you're walking, then how long you're going to be wearing them.</p><h2>Is it better to hike in shorts or leggings?</h2><p>It can be better to wear shorts when hiking if you're going to be doing it somewhere warm and sunny because your legs can move freely and your legs will stay dry and cool.</p><p>However, leggings can provide more protection from insect bites and skin chafing, plus they can provide warmth for colder temperatures.</p><h2>Does walking tone your legs?</h2><p>Yes, it’s one of the best lower impact exercises for toning your legs, as well as your thighs.</p><p>For best results, you should aim for a brisk walk that lasts at least 30 minutes each day. This should get your heart rate up as well.</p><p>You can also try longer distances at a slower pace to build muscle structure.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqysp2Wjmrmmr9OsZmppY2h%2BdoGYaJmeq6RixKK4yqKloGWcmrSotc2gqmg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html&text=10%20Best%20walking%20leggings%20for%20women%20UK%202023%2c%20including%20ladies%20waterproof%20and%20thermal%20tights&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html&title=10%20Best%20walking%20leggings%20for%20women%20UK%202023%2c%20including%20ladies%20waterproof%20and%20thermal%20tights" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html&title=10%20Best%20walking%20leggings%20for%20women%20UK%202023%2c%20including%20ladies%20waterproof%20and%20thermal%20tights" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html&title=10%20Best%20walking%20leggings%20for%20women%20UK%202023%2c%20including%20ladies%20waterproof%20and%20thermal%20tights" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-walking-leggings.html&description=10%20Best%20walking%20leggings%20for%20women%20UK%202023%2c%20including%20ladies%20waterproof%20and%20thermal%20tights" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ashlee-simpson-lucked-out-coparenting-with-pete-wentz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashlee Simpson Lucked Out Coparenting With Pete Wentz">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wendy-watson-nelson-jms6-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wendy Watson Nelson (Religious Author) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
